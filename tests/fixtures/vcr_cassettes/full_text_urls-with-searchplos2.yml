        <abstract>
        <p>Mammalian females pay high energetic costs for reproduction, the greatest of which is imposed by lactation. The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N = 113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by ∼445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring <italic>in utero</italic>. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have received little attention to date.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Since the 1970s, biologists have directed substantial research effort to understanding adaptive sex-biased allocation of maternal resources in animals and plants. Biologists have proposed numerous hypotheses for sex-biases, including local resource competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk1">[2]</xref>, “advantaged daughters” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Simpson1">[3]</xref>, local resource enhancement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Emlen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk2">[5]</xref>, the “safe bet”/reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Shibata1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Leimar1">[7]</xref> and sex-differentiated sources of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Smith1">[8]</xref>. The most well-known and investigated, though, remains the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Trivers and Willard hypothesized that a female, as a function of her condition, is expected to preferentially allocate resources to the sex that provides greater marginal return on that investment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. In polygynous mating systems characterized by male-male competition, they predicted that good condition females would bias resource allocation in favor of sons because males profit more form additional investment than do females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Collectively, the hypotheses proposed in the literature can be loosely grouped according to the extent that the directionality of the sex-bias is contingent on maternal condition; however, the predictions deriving from these hypotheses are not always mutually exclusive, complicating interpretation of empirical results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>. Large-bodied ungulates are frequently used for investigating sex-biased maternal allocation because male body size contributes substantially to success in competitive access to mating opportunities, but evidence for systematic sex-biases has been equivocal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Plabon1">[14]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although sex-ratio at birth has been the primary outcome investigated, post-natal maternal physiological transfer and behavioral care afford females substantial flexibility in sex-biased resource allocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hewison1">[12]</xref>. Sex-biased nursing behavior has been investigated as a possible proxy for sex-biased milk production in numerous mammalian taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-CluttonBrock1">[21]</xref>. Suckling behavior, however, is not useful for estimating milk energy transfer as verified by experimental use of radio-labeled isotopes in <italic>Equus caballus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron3">[22]</xref>. Direct evidence for sex-biased milk synthesis among non-domesticated species has now been reported in ungulates (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>), rodents (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>), primates (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>; <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Fujita1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref>, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Quinn1">[30]</xref> for exception), and marsupials (<italic>Macropus eugenii,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref>). Drawing systematic conclusions from the studies to date, however, is challenging in part because most have been limited by relatively small sample sizes or report milk composition without accounting for milk yield. The most comprehensive data derive from Iberian red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>) and rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>). Landete-Castillejos and colleagues showed that hinds favored sons by producing more milk with higher protein content for them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. This bias did not vary as a function of maternal mass or age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. Among rhesus macaques, mothers produced higher milk energy density [kcal/g] for sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> due to higher fat content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. There was additionally an interaction with maternal life-history; smaller, younger mothers produced even higher fat and protein concentrations for sons and lower concentrations for daughters than did multiparous mothers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. However, at peak lactation, mothers of daughters, across parities, produced greater milk volume that offset the reduced energetic density of milk for daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. These studies failed to support sex-bias hypotheses that predict mothers in better condition will preferentially allocate resources to a particular sex, suggesting instead that there may be systematic sex-biases that are independent of maternal condition.</p>
        <p>Mother’s milk, however, is particularly difficult to evaluate when investigating adaptive allocation of maternal resources. Milk synthesis is unlikely to be at the maternal optimum because of parent-offspring conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Godfray1">[33]</xref>. Rather milk reflects a complex physiological and behavioral negotiation between the mother and offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde3">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>. Functional development of the mammary gland initially occurs during pregnancy and is orchestrated by maternal and placental hormones, particularly placental lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref>. Post-natally, local regulation of milk synthesis is maintained by milk removal via offspring suckling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Daly1">39</xref> but maternal rejection can prevent or limit milk intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. As a result, sex-biased milk synthesis may reflect differential cellular capacity in the mammary gland, programmed via hormonal signals from the fetal-placental unit, or post-natally through sex-biased nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. There has been only one study that has investigated mechanisms underlying sex-biased milk synthesis. Koskela and colleagues used an elegant cross-fostering design in bank voles (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>) to demonstrate that all-female litters received significantly greater milk yield than did all-male litters, regardless of litter size or maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>. The manipulation was conducted after females gave birth, and the extent to which pre-natal mammary gland development may have been sensitive to litter sex-ratio was not reported. Litter size during gestation has been shown to influence mammary gland development in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rattray1">[40]</xref> and milk volume in goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hayden1">[41]</xref>, but the effect of fetal sex on milk synthesis has not been investigated.</p>
        <p>We investigated the magnitude and direction of sex-biased milk synthesis in the Holstein breed of <italic>Bos taurus.</italic> Although intensive artificial selection has shaped cattle during recent centuries, domesticated cattle are derived from large-bodied, sexually-dimorphic aurochs (<italic>Bos primigenius</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AjmoneMarsan1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Grigson1">[43]</xref>. Among beef cattle, several small studies have revealed sex-biased milk production that favors sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>, favors daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutledge1">[45]</xref>, or no sex-biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In contrast, standardized husbandry practices, systematic milking procedures, detailed record-keeping, and large samples sizes make the dairy cow a powerful model for the exploration of maternal milk synthesis from both functional and mechanistic perspectives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Loor1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rowson1">[48]</xref>. Birth sex-ratio in dairy cows is male-biased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that mechanisms for sex-biases are operating in this taxon. Moreover the basic architecture for lactation is more highly conserved than other components of the genome, even for an animal artificially selected for milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lemay1">[50]</xref>. Notably, because calves are removed from the dam within hours of parturition, this model system allowed us to investigate pre-natal mechanisms of sex-biased milk synthesis independent of post-natal maternal care and infant suckling behavior. Importantly, dairy cows are concurrently pregnant during lactation, typically 200+ days of the 305-day lactation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio1">[51]</xref>. We therefore predicted that milk synthesis on the first lactation could be affected not only by the sex of the calf produced, but also by the sex of the fetus gestated during lactation. We also predicted that mammary gland programming in response to fetal sex would persist into the subsequent lactation because the capacity to synthesize milk is, to some extent, cumulative across parities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lang1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Miller1">[54]</xref>. These complex predictions are clarified by schematic representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hypothesis: milk production is influenced by fetal sex across lactations.</title>
        <p>Fetal sex in pregnancy 1 may alter milk production across multiple lactations because of the critical steps in mammary development that occur during the first pregnancy. In the cow, pregnancy 2 typically overlaps with lactation 1, providing opportunity for calf sex in parity 2 to impact milk production in the first lactation.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To investigate sex-biased milk synthesis, we acquired all lactation records from 1995 to 1999 in the database managed by Dairy Records Management Systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drms.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drms.org</ext-link>). Whole-lactation milk yield and composition data were derived from monthly yield and composition data collected on commercial dairy farms across the United States. Standardized lactation curves, characterized over 5 decades of research, were then used to predict production between the monthly data points. Production is adjusted for breed, region, season and parity during the calculation of whole-lactation milk and component production, which was standardized to a 305-day lactation. These records are used daily by most of the 50,000 dairy farmers in the U.S. to make management decisions. Detailed discussions of the program and data analysis have been published elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Wiggans1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-VanRaden1">[56]</xref>. Data from the late 1990’s were used to avoid the influence of sex-selected semen in artificial breeding programs in the commercial dairy industry, which became common in the mid-2000’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Garner1">[58]</xref>. Additionally, this period of time allowed for analysis of the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Chilliard1">[59]</xref>, approved in 1993 for commercial use in the U.S. The DRMS database includes a field for reporting administration of bST that was introduced into their software (PCDart) from the start of the commercial availability of bST.</p>
        <p>Several steps were taken to clean the data prior to analysis. Only records from Holstein cattle were retained, and lactations that began with either twin births or abortions were excluded. Lactations with missing or corrupt lactation number, year, or calf sex designations were deleted. Duplicate records for a single lactation within cow were eliminated, and records for lactation ≥6 (representing 3.02% of lactations in the database) were excluded to enable repeated measures analysis of lactations with adequate representation in the database. If at least 1 of the first 5 test days, typically conducted monthly, were flagged for bST administration, then the lactation was considered bST-positive (N = 100,478; 3.9% of lactations). The final database consisted of 2.39 million lactation records, representing 1.49 million individual Holstein cows, however due to missing data in certain fields, some analyses included fewer lactations and final analysis sample sizes are reported for each analysis. Mixed models were used to evaluate the fixed effects of calf sex, parity, bST, and interactions and the random effect of year according to the following model:</p>
        <disp-formula id="pone.0086169.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0086169.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>
        <p>where Y<sub>ijkl</sub> is a dependent variable, µ is the overall mean, S<sub>i</sub> is the fixed effect of calf sex (i = 1 to 2), P<sub>j</sub> is the fixed effect of parity (j = 1 to 5), B<sub>k</sub> is the fixed effect of bST (k = 1 to 2), Y<sub>l</sub> is the random effect of year (l = 1 to 5), SP<sub>ij</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and parity, SB<sub>ik</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and bST, SPB<sub>ijk</sub> is the interaction of calf sex, parity, and bST, and e<sub>ijkl</sub> is the residual error. Repeated lactations within cow were fit to a heterogeneous autoregressive (ARH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>) covariance structure. Analyses were completed using the Mixed Procedure of SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significant interactions were investigated using the SLICE option and means were separated using the PDIFF option of SAS, with significance declared at <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05.</p>
        <p>To exclude potentially confounding effects of dystocia and bST treatment on results and to evaluate carryover effects of calf sex on multiple lactations, a more conservative data set was generated. All bST-positive lactations were deleted, and only those beginning with a calving difficulty score of 1 or 2 (no or minimal difficulty) were retained. Finally, the data were narrowed to only those cows with both lactations 1 and 2 represented, leaving 113,750 cows. Data for 305-day milk yield in lactations 1 and 2 were modeled with the fixed effects of calf sex<sub>1</sub>, calf sex<sub>2</sub>, calf sex<sub>1</sub> × calf sex<sub>2</sub>, and year. Analyses were completed using the Mixed Procedure of SAS (SAS Institute) and means were separated using the PDIFF option of SAS, with significance declared at <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05.</p>

        <p>Holsteins biased milk production in favor of daughters, producing significantly more milk over the 305 days of standard lactation after gestating a daughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These findings are based on 2.39 million lactation records from approximately 1.49 million female cows. First-parity cows giving birth to a daughter produced 142±5.4 kg more milk over the 305-day lactation period than did those giving birth to a son (7,612 vs. 7,470±69 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Similar, though marginally smaller, effects were observed in parities 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The overall effect amounted to a 1.3% increase in whole-lactation milk production for cows bearing daughters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086169-t001">Table 1</xref>). Extrapolation from total lactation production values revealed that milk composition was similar after gestation of a son or daughter. Fat concentration was 3.61% after gestation of a daughter and 3.62% after gestation of a son; protein concentrations were the same (3.17%).</p>

        <p>Lactation records from Holstein cows (N = 2.39 million lactations) were analyzed to determine effects of calf sex, parity, use of bST, and their interactions on 305-day milk production. Calf sex influence on milk production was dependent on bST use (interaction <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). A) In the absence of bST, daughters resulted in significantly greater milk production compared to sons across all parities (all <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). B) Lactations influenced by bST administration failed to consistently demonstrate the daughter bias. Daughters still conferred an advantage in first-parity cows administered bST (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), but did not significantly influence milk yield in parity 2–5 cows.

        <p>The disparity between milk produced following birth of a son vs. a daughter was largely eliminated by the use of bST. A recombinant, exogenous form of the growth hormone somatotropin, bST promotes endocrine alterations to partition a greater proportion of nutrient supply to the mammary gland, thereby increasing milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bauman1">[60]</xref>. Recombinant bST is approved for exogenous administration to dairy cows beginning at week 9 of lactation. In our sample, bST accounted for a 12% increase in whole-lactation milk yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086169-t001">Table 1</xref>). On first parity, cows administered bST still produced significantly higher milk yield if they had a daughter (8,681 vs. 8,631±71 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), but sex-biased milk synthesis was not observed in parities 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

Indeed, in our data, the odds of a son inducing dystocia (calving difficulty score ≥3 on a scale of 1 to 5) were significantly greater than for daughters (5.6 vs. 4.2% incidence, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, odds ratio 95% CI: 1.32–1.35). Nevertheless, sex-biased milk synthesis remained when analysis was restricted to a subset of the dataset (N = 113,750) that excluded cases of bST and dystocia, and included information on individual cows across the first and second parity. On first parity, cows producing daughters had significantly greater 305-day milk yield, with an advantage of 1.6% relative to cows producing sons (7,947 vs. 7,818±9.6 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The daughter advantage was also observed in parity 2, although the magnitude of the difference was reduced (0.83%; 8,515 vs. 8,445±37 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). These results indicate that the milk production advantage associated with birth of a daughter is not attributable to prevention of dystocia.</p>

        <p>Milk production on first lactation was associated with the sex of the fetus on the second pregnancy because the two overlapped temporally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Holstein dairy cows demonstrate a significant biological effect of sex-biased milk production in favor of daughters. In dairying, calves are removed on the day of birth and standardized mechanical procedures are used for milking, therefore post-natal sex-bias does not explain the results presented here. Instead milk production varied as a function of fetal sex, indicating that functional development of the mammary gland is influenced pre-natally. Importantly, lower milk yield for sons was not compensated by higher protein and fat production; total production of milk energy was greater in cows that gestated daughters. Among rhesus monkeys, mothers rearing daughters produce more milk, but of significantly lower milk energy density- the aggregated calories derived from fat, protein, and sugar- than do mothers of sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. To our knowledge, the results reported here are the first to document that fetal sex influences milk production. Moreover the effects on milk production were dynamic and persistent across parities. Importantly, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increased milk production across the first two lactations and was protective against the negative effects of male gestation on the second parity. In contrast, gestating a son on the first parity suppressed milk production on the first two lactations, but the conception of a daughter on the second parity partially improved milk production. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have been less studied.</p>
        <p>Sex-differentiated programming of the mammary gland is further substantiated by the greater effect of bST administration in cows gestating sons than cows gestating daughters. Postnatal administration of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) in multiparous cows overwhelmed the prenatal effects of offspring sex, but had a greater effect in cows gestating sons. Somatotropin, or growth hormone (GH), is produced in the anterior pituitary, stimulated by GH-releasing hormone. Most notably, GH influences metabolism in hepatic and adipose tissues, shunting more maternal bodily reserves to milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers2">[64]</xref>. Insulin-like growth factors are believed to be the major mediators of the effect of GH on the mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bauman1">[60]</xref>, however GH also directly affects the mammary gland and increases milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-PlathGabler1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Johnson1">[66]</xref>. While the mean production parameters increased with the administration of bST for cows producing both daughters and sons, the proportional increase in milk production was greater for multiparous cows gestating sons. Rose and colleagues reported that cows that had low milk yield responses to bST treatment within a herd had greater milk yields before bST treatment compared to cows with a high response in milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rose1">[67]</xref>. This is consistent with our results that cows birthing daughters had elevated milk production and a lower response to exogenous bST administration compared to their counterparts bearing sons. We posit that mechanisms underlying lower initial milk production and greater individual response to bST administration are likely responsible for the greater response to bST in cows with sons. Administration of bST in many ways represents an “experimental” manipulation of mammary gland programming and reveals possible mechanistic pathways through which sex-biases are operating. Although bST was able to overwhelm sex-biased milk synthesis among multiparous cows, significant sex-bias remained among primiparous cows whose mammary glands had functionally developed for the first time in the context of the fetal sex of the first gestation. The magnitude of sex bias is strongest among first parity rhesus monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> and possibly humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Powe1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref> and Tamar wallabies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref> in which primiparous females have been disproportionately represented in published studies. The effect of fetal sex may diminish to some extent among multiparous females due to the aggregate effects on mammary gland architecture of sequential gestations of different fetal sexes. Alternatively, maternal investment tactics may change as a function of residual reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Williams1">[68]</xref> or targeted effort during critical developmental windows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron4">[69]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These biological findings may have economic impact for the modern dairy industry. With the widespread availability of sexed-selected semen for use in artificial breeding programs, dairy managers have the option of achieving approximately 90% female pregnancies rather than a natural rate near 47% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>. There are many factors for managers to consider when evaluating the profitability of sexed semen use, including decreased conception rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref> and increased semen cost. Some published analyses have been skeptical of the economic merit of using sexed semen on dairy operations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Olynk1">[70]</xref>, although the cost of the cell sorting technology continues to drop, making recent analyses more favorable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Ribeiro1">[71]</xref>. Accounting for the impact of a female calf on lactation productivity revealed by our analysis, however, further improves the expected profitability of sexed semen use. It is common to use sexed semen for breeding nulliparous heifers only, and given the long-term impact of a first-parity daughter, the production benefits of this management strategy are substantial. The cumulative increase in milk yield over two lactations for a cow giving birth to a daughter on the first parity rather than consecutive bulls is ∼445 kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The impact of sexed semen on the structure of the dairy industry has been a complex question already <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-DeVries1">[72]</xref>, but these results highlight a key factor that has not previously been considered.</p>
        <p>The precise mechanistic pathways through which fetal sex influences mammary gland development remain unknown. Fetal-origin hormones may translocate via maternal circulation to bind directly to receptors in the dam’s mammary gland influencing functional development and subsequent milk synthesis. Among ungulates, ruminants may be especially valuable for understanding mammary gland development during pregnancy as a function of fetal sex because of their cotyledonary placenta. Klisch and Mess posited that for ruminants, an evolutionary “arms race” between the mother and fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Moore1">[73]</xref> for glucose transport, necessitated by the lack of gastrointestinal glucose supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aschenbach1">[74]</xref>, resulted in selective pressure that favored an “inefficient” placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. For example, the placenta of the domestic cow has ∼5 times the surface area as the horse placenta even though the two species produce similarly sized neonates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>. As a byproduct of the greater placental surface area, fetal steroidal hormones can readily diffuse into maternal circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. Concentrations of estrogens and androgens differ between male and female fetuses and, if in maternal circulation, potentially enhance or inhibit mammary gland development and consequently milk synthesis during lactation. In dairy cows, fetal steroid hormones are present from the first trimester and are critical for the development of fetal sex organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Yang1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Nilsson1">[78]</xref>. Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), another fetal-origin bioactive, increases in maternal circulation across pregnancy in dairy cows gestating sons and decreases in cows gestating daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AnandIvell1">[79]</xref> but the influences of fetal-origin INSL3 on the mammary gland are not known. Functional development of the mammary gland in taxa characterized by highly invasive hemochorial placentas may also be susceptible to fetal hormones; indeed the majority of reports of sex-biased milk synthesis in the literature are from taxa that have greater placental invasion and/or placental surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Capellini1">[80]</xref>. Suggestively, human mothers with higher concentrations of circulating androgens during the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester had a lower probability of sustaining breastfeeding to three months post-partum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Carlsen1">[81]</xref>. The higher circulating androgens may have originated from fetal sons, but the effect of fetal sex was not directly analyzed in that study, nor was milk synthesis measured. Indirectly, fetal sex may influence the production of placental lactogen, a primary hormonal driver of mammary gland development during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref> but as of yet differences in placental lactogen as a function of fetal sex have not been reported.</p>
        <p>Daughter-biased milk synthesis may reflect adaptive maternal allocation in response to fetal sex, adaptive fetal manipulation of maternal physiology, or may be a by-product of the maternal-fetal interface. Importantly, uniformly biased milk production in favor of daughters across maternal conditions does not support the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>, or other hypotheses positing facultative sex-biased allocation of resources as a function of maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>.

The mediating effect of maternal condition on birth-sex ratio has been inconsistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Meier1">[83]</xref> as has been the directionality of birth sex-ratio bias. Better-condition cows may produce more sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Roche1">[84]</xref> or daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hohenbrink1">[85]</xref>. Integrating the results presented here, dairy cows produce more sons, but seemingly favor daughters with more milk. Mammalian mothers in polygynous taxa may preferentially allocate physiological resources to daughters so that they are able to initiate reproduction at relatively younger ages than do sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde4">[86]</xref>. For female mammals, because of the temporal constraints of pregnancy and lactation, lifetime reproductive success of daughters will be contingent on the length of their reproductive careers, a function of age at first birth and longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Blomquist1">[87]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Martin1">[88]</xref>. Among sexually dimorphic polygynous taxa, the temporal constraints are relaxed for males, who benefit from growing bigger and stronger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Willisch1">[89]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-FestaBianchet1">[90]</xref>, allowing males more time to compensate for deficits in early life maternal investment before becoming reproductively active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bercovitch2">[91]</xref>. Daughter-biased milk production may involve life-history tradeoffs for both cows and their daughters. High milk production in dairy cows is generally associated with reduced fertility, health, and survival depending on environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Windig1">[92]</xref>. Moreover daughters gestated during lactation have moderately reduced survival and milk production in their own adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio2">[93]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Berry1">[94]</xref>. Although we do not know whether the magnitude of the effects presented here is correlated with such consequences, future research should investigate the fitness effects of daughter-biased milk synthesis both in the short-term (i.e. inter-birth interval), across the lifetime, and inter-generationally.</p>
        <p>The question remains though, under natural conditions how do bull calves grow faster during the post-natal period if their dams are producing less milk, and therefore lower total protein and fat production? One explanation may be that females bias nursing behavior such that milk production is up-regulated for sons, a tactic we could not evaluate in conventional dairying as calves are removed after birth. Landete-Castillejos and colleagues revealed that among captive Iberian red deer, dams rearing sons had greater total milk production and total protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>, possibly due to post-natal hind-calf behavioral dynamics. However in the one study to date of cow maternal behavior, cows do not show any sex biases in nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. In beef cattle that are reared by their dam, sons are born bigger and have better post-natal growth than do daughters, but only one out of three studies has shown any evidence of male-biased milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In the absence of post-natal behavioral modifications of prenatal mammary gland programming, the presence and concentration of other milk bioactives such as immunofactors and hormones that influence offspring development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref> may differ in milk produced for sons and daughters. Notably, investigations of sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories, however, overwhelmingly essentialize the role of the mother and sex-biased allocation of maternal resources. More often overlooked are sexually differentiated mechanisms within offspring that influence utilization and assimilation of early life nutrition and environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Badyaev1">[95]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aiken1">[96]</xref>. Consideration of progeny-specific adaptations as well as biased maternal effort will contribute to a better understanding of the ontogeny of sexual dimorphism.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>Mammalian females pay high energetic costs for reproduction, the greatest of which is imposed by lactation. The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N = 113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by ∼445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring <italic>in utero</italic>. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have received little attention to date.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Since the 1970s, biologists have directed substantial research effort to understanding adaptive sex-biased allocation of maternal resources in animals and plants. Biologists have proposed numerous hypotheses for sex-biases, including local resource competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk1">[2]</xref>, “advantaged daughters” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Simpson1">[3]</xref>, local resource enhancement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Emlen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk2">[5]</xref>, the “safe bet”/reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Shibata1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Leimar1">[7]</xref> and sex-differentiated sources of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Smith1">[8]</xref>. The most well-known and investigated, though, remains the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Trivers and Willard hypothesized that a female, as a function of her condition, is expected to preferentially allocate resources to the sex that provides greater marginal return on that investment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. In polygynous mating systems characterized by male-male competition, they predicted that good condition females would bias resource allocation in favor of sons because males profit more form additional investment than do females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Collectively, the hypotheses proposed in the literature can be loosely grouped according to the extent that the directionality of the sex-bias is contingent on maternal condition; however, the predictions deriving from these hypotheses are not always mutually exclusive, complicating interpretation of empirical results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>. Large-bodied ungulates are frequently used for investigating sex-biased maternal allocation because male body size contributes substantially to success in competitive access to mating opportunities, but evidence for systematic sex-biases has been equivocal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Plabon1">[14]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although sex-ratio at birth has been the primary outcome investigated, post-natal maternal physiological transfer and behavioral care afford females substantial flexibility in sex-biased resource allocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hewison1">[12]</xref>. Sex-biased nursing behavior has been investigated as a possible proxy for sex-biased milk production in numerous mammalian taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-CluttonBrock1">[21]</xref>. Suckling behavior, however, is not useful for estimating milk energy transfer as verified by experimental use of radio-labeled isotopes in <italic>Equus caballus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron3">[22]</xref>. Direct evidence for sex-biased milk synthesis among non-domesticated species has now been reported in ungulates (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>), rodents (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>), primates (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>; <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Fujita1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref>, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Quinn1">[30]</xref> for exception), and marsupials (<italic>Macropus eugenii,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref>). Drawing systematic conclusions from the studies to date, however, is challenging in part because most have been limited by relatively small sample sizes or report milk composition without accounting for milk yield. The most comprehensive data derive from Iberian red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>) and rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>). Landete-Castillejos and colleagues showed that hinds favored sons by producing more milk with higher protein content for them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. This bias did not vary as a function of maternal mass or age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. Among rhesus macaques, mothers produced higher milk energy density [kcal/g] for sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> due to higher fat content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. There was additionally an interaction with maternal life-history; smaller, younger mothers produced even higher fat and protein concentrations for sons and lower concentrations for daughters than did multiparous mothers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. However, at peak lactation, mothers of daughters, across parities, produced greater milk volume that offset the reduced energetic density of milk for daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. These studies failed to support sex-bias hypotheses that predict mothers in better condition will preferentially allocate resources to a particular sex, suggesting instead that there may be systematic sex-biases that are independent of maternal condition.</p>
        <p>Mother’s milk, however, is particularly difficult to evaluate when investigating adaptive allocation of maternal resources. Milk synthesis is unlikely to be at the maternal optimum because of parent-offspring conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Godfray1">[33]</xref>. Rather milk reflects a complex physiological and behavioral negotiation between the mother and offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde3">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>. Functional development of the mammary gland initially occurs during pregnancy and is orchestrated by maternal and placental hormones, particularly placental lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref>. Post-natally, local regulation of milk synthesis is maintained by milk removal via offspring suckling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Daly1">39</xref> but maternal rejection can prevent or limit milk intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. As a result, sex-biased milk synthesis may reflect differential cellular capacity in the mammary gland, programmed via hormonal signals from the fetal-placental unit, or post-natally through sex-biased nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. There has been only one study that has investigated mechanisms underlying sex-biased milk synthesis. Koskela and colleagues used an elegant cross-fostering design in bank voles (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>) to demonstrate that all-female litters received significantly greater milk yield than did all-male litters, regardless of litter size or maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>. The manipulation was conducted after females gave birth, and the extent to which pre-natal mammary gland development may have been sensitive to litter sex-ratio was not reported. Litter size during gestation has been shown to influence mammary gland development in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rattray1">[40]</xref> and milk volume in goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hayden1">[41]</xref>, but the effect of fetal sex on milk synthesis has not been investigated.</p>
        <p>We investigated the magnitude and direction of sex-biased milk synthesis in the Holstein breed of <italic>Bos taurus.</italic> Although intensive artificial selection has shaped cattle during recent centuries, domesticated cattle are derived from large-bodied, sexually-dimorphic aurochs (<italic>Bos primigenius</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AjmoneMarsan1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Grigson1">[43]</xref>. Among beef cattle, several small studies have revealed sex-biased milk production that favors sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>, favors daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutledge1">[45]</xref>, or no sex-biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In contrast, standardized husbandry practices, systematic milking procedures, detailed record-keeping, and large samples sizes make the dairy cow a powerful model for the exploration of maternal milk synthesis from both functional and mechanistic perspectives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Loor1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rowson1">[48]</xref>. Birth sex-ratio in dairy cows is male-biased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that mechanisms for sex-biases are operating in this taxon. Moreover the basic architecture for lactation is more highly conserved than other components of the genome, even for an animal artificially selected for milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lemay1">[50]</xref>. Notably, because calves are removed from the dam within hours of parturition, this model system allowed us to investigate pre-natal mechanisms of sex-biased milk synthesis independent of post-natal maternal care and infant suckling behavior. Importantly, dairy cows are concurrently pregnant during lactation, typically 200+ days of the 305-day lactation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio1">[51]</xref>. We therefore predicted that milk synthesis on the first lactation could be affected not only by the sex of the calf produced, but also by the sex of the fetus gestated during lactation. We also predicted that mammary gland programming in response to fetal sex would persist into the subsequent lactation because the capacity to synthesize milk is, to some extent, cumulative across parities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lang1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Miller1">[54]</xref>. These complex predictions are clarified by schematic representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hypothesis: milk production is influenced by fetal sex across lactations.</title>
        <p>Fetal sex in pregnancy 1 may alter milk production across multiple lactations because of the critical steps in mammary development that occur during the first pregnancy. In the cow, pregnancy 2 typically overlaps with lactation 1, providing opportunity for calf sex in parity 2 to impact milk production in the first lactation.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To investigate sex-biased milk synthesis, we acquired all lactation records from 1995 to 1999 in the database managed by Dairy Records Management Systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drms.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drms.org</ext-link>). Whole-lactation milk yield and composition data were derived from monthly yield and composition data collected on commercial dairy farms across the United States. Standardized lactation curves, characterized over 5 decades of research, were then used to predict production between the monthly data points. Production is adjusted for breed, region, season and parity during the calculation of whole-lactation milk and component production, which was standardized to a 305-day lactation. These records are used daily by most of the 50,000 dairy farmers in the U.S. to make management decisions. Detailed discussions of the program and data analysis have been published elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Wiggans1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-VanRaden1">[56]</xref>. Data from the late 1990’s were used to avoid the influence of sex-selected semen in artificial breeding programs in the commercial dairy industry, which became common in the mid-2000’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Garner1">[58]</xref>. Additionally, this period of time allowed for analysis of the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Chilliard1">[59]</xref>, approved in 1993 for commercial use in the U.S. The DRMS database includes a field for reporting administration of bST that was introduced into their software (PCDart) from the start of the commercial availability of bST.</p>
        <p>Several steps were taken to clean the data prior to analysis. Only records from Holstein cattle were retained, and lactations that began with either twin births or abortions were excluded. Lactations with missing or corrupt lactation number, year, or calf sex designations were deleted. Duplicate records for a single lactation within cow were eliminated, and records for lactation ≥6 (representing 3.02% of lactations in the database) were excluded to enable repeated measures analysis of lactations with adequate representation in the database. If at least 1 of the first 5 test days, typically conducted monthly, were flagged for bST administration, then the lactation was considered bST-positive (N = 100,478; 3.9% of lactations). The final database consisted of 2.39 million lactation records, representing 1.49 million individual Holstein cows, however due to missing data in certain fields, some analyses included fewer lactations and final analysis sample sizes are reported for each analysis. Mixed models were used to evaluate the fixed effects of calf sex, parity, bST, and interactions and the random effect of year according to the following model:</p>

        <p>where Y<sub>ijkl</sub> is a dependent variable, µ is the overall mean, S<sub>i</sub> is the fixed effect of calf sex (i = 1 to 2), P<sub>j</sub> is the fixed effect of parity (j = 1 to 5), B<sub>k</sub> is the fixed effect of bST (k = 1 to 2), Y<sub>l</sub> is the random effect of year (l = 1 to 5), SP<sub>ij</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and parity, SB<sub>ik</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and bST, SPB<sub>ijk</sub> is the interaction of calf sex, parity, and bST, and e<sub>ijkl</sub> is the residual error. Repeated lactations within cow were fit to a heterogeneous autoregressive (ARH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>) covariance structure. Analyses were completed using the Mixed Procedure of SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significant interactions were investigated using the SLICE option and means were separated using the PDIFF option of SAS, with significance declared at <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05.</p>
        <p>To exclude potentially confounding effects of dystocia and bST treatment on results and to evaluate carryover effects of calf sex on multiple lactations, a more conservative data set was generated. All bST-positive lactations were deleted, and only those beginning with a calving difficulty score of 1 or 2 (no or minimal difficulty) were retained. Finally, the data were narrowed to only those cows with both lactations 1 and 2 represented, leaving 113,750 cows. Data for 305-day milk yield in lactations 1 and 2 were modeled with the fixed effects of calf sex<sub>1</sub>, calf sex<sub>2</sub>, calf sex<sub>1</sub> × calf sex<sub>2</sub>, and year.

These findings are based on 2.39 million lactation records from approximately 1.49 million female cows.

Similar, though marginally smaller, effects were observed in parities 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The overall effect amounted to a 1.3% increase in whole-lactation milk production for cows bearing daughters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086169-t001">Table 1</xref>). Extrapolation from total lactation production values revealed that milk composition was similar after gestation of a son or daughter. Fat concentration was 3.61% after gestation of a daughter and 3.62% after gestation of a son; protein concentrations were the same (3.17%).</p>

        <p>The disparity between milk produced following birth of a son vs. a daughter was largely eliminated by the use of bST. A recombinant, exogenous form of the growth hormone somatotropin, bST promotes endocrine alterations to partition a greater proportion of nutrient supply to the mammary gland, thereby increasing milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bauman1">[60]</xref>. Recombinant bST is approved for exogenous administration to dairy cows beginning at week 9 of lactation. In our sample, bST accounted for a 12% increase in whole-lactation milk yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086169-t001">Table 1</xref>). On first parity, cows administered bST still produced significantly higher milk yield if they had a daughter (8,681 vs. 8,631±71 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), but sex-biased milk synthesis was not observed in parities 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

Nevertheless, sex-biased milk synthesis remained when analysis was restricted to a subset of the dataset (N = 113,750) that excluded cases of bST and dystocia, and included information on individual cows across the first and second parity. On first parity, cows producing daughters had significantly greater 305-day milk yield, with an advantage of 1.6% relative to cows producing sons (7,947 vs. 7,818±9.6 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The daughter advantage was also observed in parity 2, although the magnitude of the difference was reduced (0.83%; 8,515 vs. 8,445±37 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). These results indicate that the milk production advantage associated with birth of a daughter is not attributable to prevention of dystocia.</p>

        <p>Milk production on first lactation was associated with the sex of the fetus on the second pregnancy because the two overlapped temporally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>Cows (n = 113,750) with both first and second parity lactation records, with no reports of dystocia or bST administration, were used to assess effects of calf sex on milk production in the first 2 lactations.

Means labeled with different letters differ (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and those with common labels do not (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.10). A) First-parity cows having a daughter produced significantly more milk than those having a son, but gestating a daughter in pregnancy 2 increased milk production in cows that had a son first. B) Second-parity milk production is greatest in cows that had a daughter in pregnancy 1. Additionally, cows with a son in pregnancy 1 showed increased milk production if they had a daughter in pregnancy 2.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Holstein dairy cows demonstrate a significant biological effect of sex-biased milk production in favor of daughters. In dairying, calves are removed on the day of birth and standardized mechanical procedures are used for milking, therefore post-natal sex-bias does not explain the results presented here. Instead milk production varied as a function of fetal sex, indicating that functional development of the mammary gland is influenced pre-natally. Importantly, lower milk yield for sons was not compensated by higher protein and fat production; total production of milk energy was greater in cows that gestated daughters. Among rhesus monkeys, mothers rearing daughters produce more milk, but of significantly lower milk energy density- the aggregated calories derived from fat, protein, and sugar- than do mothers of sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. To our knowledge, the results reported here are the first to document that fetal sex influences milk production. Moreover the effects on milk production were dynamic and persistent across parities. Importantly, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increased milk production across the first two lactations and was protective against the negative effects of male gestation on the second parity. In contrast, gestating a son on the first parity suppressed milk production on the first two lactations, but the conception of a daughter on the second parity partially improved milk production. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have been less studied.</p>
        <p>Sex-differentiated programming of the mammary gland is further substantiated by the greater effect of bST administration in cows gestating sons than cows gestating daughters. Postnatal administration of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) in multiparous cows overwhelmed the prenatal effects of offspring sex, but had a greater effect in cows gestating sons. Somatotropin, or growth hormone (GH), is produced in the anterior pituitary, stimulated by GH-releasing hormone. Most notably, GH influences metabolism in hepatic and adipose tissues, shunting more maternal bodily reserves to milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers2">[64]</xref>. Insulin-like growth factors are believed to be the major mediators of the effect of GH on the mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bauman1">[60]</xref>, however GH also directly affects the mammary gland and increases milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-PlathGabler1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Johnson1">[66]</xref>. While the mean production parameters increased with the administration of bST for cows producing both daughters and sons, the proportional increase in milk production was greater for multiparous cows gestating sons. Rose and colleagues reported that cows that had low milk yield responses to bST treatment within a herd had greater milk yields before bST treatment compared to cows with a high response in milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rose1">[67]</xref>. This is consistent with our results that cows birthing daughters had elevated milk production and a lower response to exogenous bST administration compared to their counterparts bearing sons. We posit that mechanisms underlying lower initial milk production and greater individual response to bST administration are likely responsible for the greater response to bST in cows with sons. Administration of bST in many ways represents an “experimental” manipulation of mammary gland programming and reveals possible mechanistic pathways through which sex-biases are operating. Although bST was able to overwhelm sex-biased milk synthesis among multiparous cows, significant sex-bias remained among primiparous cows whose mammary glands had functionally developed for the first time in the context of the fetal sex of the first gestation. The magnitude of sex bias is strongest among first parity rhesus monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> and possibly humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Powe1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref> and Tamar wallabies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref> in which primiparous females have been disproportionately represented in published studies. The effect of fetal sex may diminish to some extent among multiparous females due to the aggregate effects on mammary gland architecture of sequential gestations of different fetal sexes. Alternatively, maternal investment tactics may change as a function of residual reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Williams1">[68]</xref> or targeted effort during critical developmental windows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron4">[69]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These biological findings may have economic impact for the modern dairy industry. With the widespread availability of sexed-selected semen for use in artificial breeding programs, dairy managers have the option of achieving approximately 90% female pregnancies rather than a natural rate near 47% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>. There are many factors for managers to consider when evaluating the profitability of sexed semen use, including decreased conception rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref> and increased semen cost. Some published analyses have been skeptical of the economic merit of using sexed semen on dairy operations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Olynk1">[70]</xref>, although the cost of the cell sorting technology continues to drop, making recent analyses more favorable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Ribeiro1">[71]</xref>. Accounting for the impact of a female calf on lactation productivity revealed by our analysis, however, further improves the expected profitability of sexed semen use. It is common to use sexed semen for breeding nulliparous heifers only, and given the long-term impact of a first-parity daughter, the production benefits of this management strategy are substantial. The cumulative increase in milk yield over two lactations for a cow giving birth to a daughter on the first parity rather than consecutive bulls is ∼445 kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The impact of sexed semen on the structure of the dairy industry has been a complex question already <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-DeVries1">[72]</xref>, but these results highlight a key factor that has not previously been considered.</p>
        <p>The precise mechanistic pathways through which fetal sex influences mammary gland development remain unknown. Fetal-origin hormones may translocate via maternal circulation to bind directly to receptors in the dam’s mammary gland influencing functional development and subsequent milk synthesis. Among ungulates, ruminants may be especially valuable for understanding mammary gland development during pregnancy as a function of fetal sex because of their cotyledonary placenta. Klisch and Mess posited that for ruminants, an evolutionary “arms race” between the mother and fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Moore1">[73]</xref> for glucose transport, necessitated by the lack of gastrointestinal glucose supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aschenbach1">[74]</xref>, resulted in selective pressure that favored an “inefficient” placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. For example, the placenta of the domestic cow has ∼5 times the surface area as the horse placenta even though the two species produce similarly sized neonates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>. As a byproduct of the greater placental surface area, fetal steroidal hormones can readily diffuse into maternal circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. Concentrations of estrogens and androgens differ between male and female fetuses and, if in maternal circulation, potentially enhance or inhibit mammary gland development and consequently milk synthesis during lactation. In dairy cows, fetal steroid hormones are present from the first trimester and are critical for the development of fetal sex organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Yang1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Nilsson1">[78]</xref>. Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), another fetal-origin bioactive, increases in maternal circulation across pregnancy in dairy cows gestating sons and decreases in cows gestating daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AnandIvell1">[79]</xref> but the influences of fetal-origin INSL3 on the mammary gland are not known. Functional development of the mammary gland in taxa characterized by highly invasive hemochorial placentas may also be susceptible to fetal hormones; indeed the majority of reports of sex-biased milk synthesis in the literature are from taxa that have greater placental invasion and/or placental surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Capellini1">[80]</xref>. Suggestively, human mothers with higher concentrations of circulating androgens during the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester had a lower probability of sustaining breastfeeding to three months post-partum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Carlsen1">[81]</xref>. The higher circulating androgens may have originated from fetal sons, but the effect of fetal sex was not directly analyzed in that study, nor was milk synthesis measured. Indirectly, fetal sex may influence the production of placental lactogen, a primary hormonal driver of mammary gland development during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref> but as of yet differences in placental lactogen as a function of fetal sex have not been reported.</p>
        <p>Daughter-biased milk synthesis may reflect adaptive maternal allocation in response to fetal sex, adaptive fetal manipulation of maternal physiology, or may be a by-product of the maternal-fetal interface. Importantly, uniformly biased milk production in favor of daughters across maternal conditions does not support the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>, or other hypotheses positing facultative sex-biased allocation of resources as a function of maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>. Dairy cows have a male-biased birth ratio; in the absence of sex-specific artificial insemination, between 50–54% of calves born are male <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Foote1">[82]</xref>. The mediating effect of maternal condition on birth-sex ratio has been inconsistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Meier1">[83]</xref> as has been the directionality of birth sex-ratio bias. Better-condition cows may produce more sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Roche1">[84]</xref> or daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hohenbrink1">[85]</xref>. Integrating the results presented here, dairy cows produce more sons, but seemingly favor daughters with more milk. Mammalian mothers in polygynous taxa may preferentially allocate physiological resources to daughters so that they are able to initiate reproduction at relatively younger ages than do sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde4">[86]</xref>. For female mammals, because of the temporal constraints of pregnancy and lactation, lifetime reproductive success of daughters will be contingent on the length of their reproductive careers, a function of age at first birth and longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Blomquist1">[87]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Martin1">[88]</xref>. Among sexually dimorphic polygynous taxa, the temporal constraints are relaxed for males, who benefit from growing bigger and stronger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Willisch1">[89]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-FestaBianchet1">[90]</xref>, allowing males more time to compensate for deficits in early life maternal investment before becoming reproductively active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bercovitch2">[91]</xref>. Daughter-biased milk production may involve life-history tradeoffs for both cows and their daughters. High milk production in dairy cows is generally associated with reduced fertility, health, and survival depending on environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Windig1">[92]</xref>. Moreover daughters gestated during lactation have moderately reduced survival and milk production in their own adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio2">[93]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Berry1">[94]</xref>. Although we do not know whether the magnitude of the effects presented here is correlated with such consequences, future research should investigate the fitness effects of daughter-biased milk synthesis both in the short-term (i.e. inter-birth interval), across the lifetime, and inter-generationally.</p>
        <p>The question remains though, under natural conditions how do bull calves grow faster during the post-natal period if their dams are producing less milk, and therefore lower total protein and fat production? One explanation may be that females bias nursing behavior such that milk production is up-regulated for sons, a tactic we could not evaluate in conventional dairying as calves are removed after birth. Landete-Castillejos and colleagues revealed that among captive Iberian red deer, dams rearing sons had greater total milk production and total protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>, possibly due to post-natal hind-calf behavioral dynamics. However in the one study to date of cow maternal behavior, cows do not show any sex biases in nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. In beef cattle that are reared by their dam, sons are born bigger and have better post-natal growth than do daughters, but only one out of three studies has shown any evidence of male-biased milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In the absence of post-natal behavioral modifications of prenatal mammary gland programming, the presence and concentration of other milk bioactives such as immunofactors and hormones that influence offspring development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref> may differ in milk produced for sons and daughters. Notably, investigations of sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories, however, overwhelmingly essentialize the role of the mother and sex-biased allocation of maternal resources. More often overlooked are sexually differentiated mechanisms within offspring that influence utilization and assimilation of early life nutrition and environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Badyaev1">[95]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aiken1">[96]</xref>. Consideration of progeny-specific adaptations as well as biased maternal effort will contribute to a better understanding of the ontogeny of sexual dimorphism.</p>

        <abstract>
        <p>Mammalian females pay high energetic costs for reproduction, the greatest of which is imposed by lactation. The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N = 113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by ∼445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring <italic>in utero</italic>. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have received little attention to date.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Since the 1970s, biologists have directed substantial research effort to understanding adaptive sex-biased allocation of maternal resources in animals and plants. Biologists have proposed numerous hypotheses for sex-biases, including local resource competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk1">[2]</xref>, “advantaged daughters” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Simpson1">[3]</xref>, local resource enhancement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Emlen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Silk2">[5]</xref>, the “safe bet”/reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Shibata1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Leimar1">[7]</xref> and sex-differentiated sources of mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Smith1">[8]</xref>. The most well-known and investigated, though, remains the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Trivers and Willard hypothesized that a female, as a function of her condition, is expected to preferentially allocate resources to the sex that provides greater marginal return on that investment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. In polygynous mating systems characterized by male-male competition, they predicted that good condition females would bias resource allocation in favor of sons because males profit more form additional investment than do females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>. Collectively, the hypotheses proposed in the literature can be loosely grouped according to the extent that the directionality of the sex-bias is contingent on maternal condition; however, the predictions deriving from these hypotheses are not always mutually exclusive, complicating interpretation of empirical results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>. Large-bodied ungulates are frequently used for investigating sex-biased maternal allocation because male body size contributes substantially to success in competitive access to mating opportunities, but evidence for systematic sex-biases has been equivocal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Plabon1">[14]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although sex-ratio at birth has been the primary outcome investigated, post-natal maternal physiological transfer and behavioral care afford females substantial flexibility in sex-biased resource allocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hewison1">[12]</xref>. Sex-biased nursing behavior has been investigated as a possible proxy for sex-biased milk production in numerous mammalian taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-CluttonBrock1">[21]</xref>. Suckling behavior, however, is not useful for estimating milk energy transfer as verified by experimental use of radio-labeled isotopes in <italic>Equus caballus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron3">[22]</xref>. Direct evidence for sex-biased milk synthesis among non-domesticated species has now been reported in ungulates (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>), rodents (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>), primates (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>; <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Fujita1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref>, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Quinn1">[30]</xref> for exception), and marsupials (<italic>Macropus eugenii,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref>). Drawing systematic conclusions from the studies to date, however, is challenging in part because most have been limited by relatively small sample sizes or report milk composition without accounting for milk yield. The most comprehensive data derive from Iberian red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus hispanicus</italic>) and rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>). Landete-Castillejos and colleagues showed that hinds favored sons by producing more milk with higher protein content for them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. This bias did not vary as a function of maternal mass or age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>. Among rhesus macaques, mothers produced higher milk energy density [kcal/g] for sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> due to higher fat content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. There was additionally an interaction with maternal life-history; smaller, younger mothers produced even higher fat and protein concentrations for sons and lower concentrations for daughters than did multiparous mothers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>. However, at peak lactation, mothers of daughters, across parities, produced greater milk volume that offset the reduced energetic density of milk for daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. These studies failed to support sex-bias hypotheses that predict mothers in better condition will preferentially allocate resources to a particular sex, suggesting instead that there may be systematic sex-biases that are independent of maternal condition.</p>
        <p>Mother’s milk, however, is particularly difficult to evaluate when investigating adaptive allocation of maternal resources. Milk synthesis is unlikely to be at the maternal optimum because of parent-offspring conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers2">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Godfray1">[33]</xref>. Rather milk reflects a complex physiological and behavioral negotiation between the mother and offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde3">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>. Functional development of the mammary gland initially occurs during pregnancy and is orchestrated by maternal and placental hormones, particularly placental lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref>. Post-natally, local regulation of milk synthesis is maintained by milk removal via offspring suckling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Daly1">39</xref> but maternal rejection can prevent or limit milk intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. As a result, sex-biased milk synthesis may reflect differential cellular capacity in the mammary gland, programmed via hormonal signals from the fetal-placental unit, or post-natally through sex-biased nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. There has been only one study that has investigated mechanisms underlying sex-biased milk synthesis. Koskela and colleagues used an elegant cross-fostering design in bank voles (<italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>) to demonstrate that all-female litters received significantly greater milk yield than did all-male litters, regardless of litter size or maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Koskela1">[24]</xref>. The manipulation was conducted after females gave birth, and the extent to which pre-natal mammary gland development may have been sensitive to litter sex-ratio was not reported. Litter size during gestation has been shown to influence mammary gland development in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rattray1">[40]</xref> and milk volume in goats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hayden1">[41]</xref>, but the effect of fetal sex on milk synthesis has not been investigated.</p>
        <p>We investigated the magnitude and direction of sex-biased milk synthesis in the Holstein breed of <italic>Bos taurus.</italic> Although intensive artificial selection has shaped cattle during recent centuries, domesticated cattle are derived from large-bodied, sexually-dimorphic aurochs (<italic>Bos primigenius</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AjmoneMarsan1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Grigson1">[43]</xref>. Among beef cattle, several small studies have revealed sex-biased milk production that favors sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>, favors daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutledge1">[45]</xref>, or no sex-biases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In contrast, standardized husbandry practices, systematic milking procedures, detailed record-keeping, and large samples sizes make the dairy cow a powerful model for the exploration of maternal milk synthesis from both functional and mechanistic perspectives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Loor1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rowson1">[48]</xref>. Birth sex-ratio in dairy cows is male-biased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that mechanisms for sex-biases are operating in this taxon. Moreover the basic architecture for lactation is more highly conserved than other components of the genome, even for an animal artificially selected for milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lemay1">[50]</xref>. Notably, because calves are removed from the dam within hours of parturition, this model system allowed us to investigate pre-natal mechanisms of sex-biased milk synthesis independent of post-natal maternal care and infant suckling behavior. Importantly, dairy cows are concurrently pregnant during lactation, typically 200+ days of the 305-day lactation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio1">[51]</xref>. We therefore predicted that milk synthesis on the first lactation could be affected not only by the sex of the calf produced, but also by the sex of the fetus gestated during lactation. We also predicted that mammary gland programming in response to fetal sex would persist into the subsequent lactation because the capacity to synthesize milk is, to some extent, cumulative across parities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Lang1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Miller1">[54]</xref>. These complex predictions are clarified by schematic representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hypothesis: milk production is influenced by fetal sex across lactations.</title>
        <p>Fetal sex in pregnancy 1 may alter milk production across multiple lactations because of the critical steps in mammary development that occur during the first pregnancy. In the cow, pregnancy 2 typically overlaps with lactation 1, providing opportunity for calf sex in parity 2 to impact milk production in the first lactation.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To investigate sex-biased milk synthesis, we acquired all lactation records from 1995 to 1999 in the database managed by Dairy Records Management Systems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drms.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drms.org</ext-link>). Whole-lactation milk yield and composition data were derived from monthly yield and composition data collected on commercial dairy farms across the United States. Standardized lactation curves, characterized over 5 decades of research, were then used to predict production between the monthly data points. Production is adjusted for breed, region, season and parity during the calculation of whole-lactation milk and component production, which was standardized to a 305-day lactation. These records are used daily by most of the 50,000 dairy farmers in the U.S. to make management decisions. Detailed discussions of the program and data analysis have been published elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Wiggans1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-VanRaden1">[56]</xref>. Data from the late 1990’s were used to avoid the influence of sex-selected semen in artificial breeding programs in the commercial dairy industry, which became common in the mid-2000’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Garner1">[58]</xref>. Additionally, this period of time allowed for analysis of the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Chilliard1">[59]</xref>, approved in 1993 for commercial use in the U.S. The DRMS database includes a field for reporting administration of bST that was introduced into their software (PCDart) from the start of the commercial availability of bST.</p>
        <p>Several steps were taken to clean the data prior to analysis. Only records from Holstein cattle were retained, and lactations that began with either twin births or abortions were excluded. Lactations with missing or corrupt lactation number, year, or calf sex designations were deleted. Duplicate records for a single lactation within cow were eliminated, and records for lactation ≥6 (representing 3.02% of lactations in the database) were excluded to enable repeated measures analysis of lactations with adequate representation in the database. If at least 1 of the first 5 test days, typically conducted monthly, were flagged for bST administration, then the lactation was considered bST-positive (N = 100,478; 3.9% of lactations). The final database consisted of 2.39 million lactation records, representing 1.49 million individual Holstein cows, however due to missing data in certain fields, some analyses included fewer lactations and final analysis sample sizes are reported for each analysis. Mixed models were used to evaluate the fixed effects of calf sex, parity, bST, and interactions and the random effect of year according to the following model:</p>

        <p>where Y<sub>ijkl</sub> is a dependent variable, µ is the overall mean, S<sub>i</sub> is the fixed effect of calf sex (i = 1 to 2), P<sub>j</sub> is the fixed effect of parity (j = 1 to 5), B<sub>k</sub> is the fixed effect of bST (k = 1 to 2), Y<sub>l</sub> is the random effect of year (l = 1 to 5), SP<sub>ij</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and parity, SB<sub>ik</sub> is the interaction of calf sex and bST, SPB<sub>ijk</sub> is the interaction of calf sex, parity, and bST, and e<sub>ijkl</sub> is the residual error. Repeated lactations within cow were fit to a heterogeneous autoregressive (ARH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Clark1">[1]</xref>) covariance structure.

Significant interactions were investigated using the SLICE option and means were separated using the PDIFF option of SAS, with significance declared at <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05.</p>
        <p>To exclude potentially confounding effects of dystocia and bST treatment on results and to evaluate carryover effects of calf sex on multiple lactations, a more conservative data set was generated. All bST-positive lactations were deleted, and only those beginning with a calving difficulty score of 1 or 2 (no or minimal difficulty) were retained. Finally, the data were narrowed to only those cows with both lactations 1 and 2 represented, leaving 113,750 cows. Data for 305-day milk yield in lactations 1 and 2 were modeled with the fixed effects of calf sex<sub>1</sub>, calf sex<sub>2</sub>, calf sex<sub>1</sub> × calf sex<sub>2</sub>, and year.

        <p>Holsteins biased milk production in favor of daughters, producing significantly more milk over the 305 days of standard lactation after gestating a daughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These findings are based on 2.39 million lactation records from approximately 1.49 million female cows. First-parity cows giving birth to a daughter produced 142±5.4 kg more milk over the 305-day lactation period than did those giving birth to a son (7,612 vs. 7,470±69 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Similar, though marginally smaller, effects were observed in parities 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The overall effect amounted to a 1.3% increase in whole-lactation milk production for cows bearing daughters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0086169-t001">Table 1</xref>). Extrapolation from total lactation production values revealed that milk composition was similar after gestation of a son or daughter. Fat concentration was 3.61% after gestation of a daughter and 3.62% after gestation of a son; protein concentrations were the same (3.17%).</p>

        <p>Lactation records from Holstein cows (N = 2.39 million lactations) were analyzed to determine effects of calf sex, parity, use of bST, and their interactions on 305-day milk production.

        <p>The disparity between milk produced following birth of a son vs. a daughter was largely eliminated by the use of bST.

        <title>Sex-Biased Milk Synthesis: Conservative Sample</title>

Dystocia is associated with decreases in whole-lactation milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Dematawena1">[62]</xref>, and we hypothesized that the milk yield advantage conferred by a daughter might have been at least partly due to decreased incidence of dystocia compared to delivery of sons. Indeed, in our data, the odds of a son inducing dystocia (calving difficulty score ≥3 on a scale of 1 to 5) were significantly greater than for daughters (5.6 vs. 4.2% incidence, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, odds ratio 95% CI: 1.32–1.35). Nevertheless, sex-biased milk synthesis remained when analysis was restricted to a subset of the dataset (N = 113,750) that excluded cases of bST and dystocia, and included information on individual cows across the first and second parity. On first parity, cows producing daughters had significantly greater 305-day milk yield, with an advantage of 1.6% relative to cows producing sons (7,947 vs. 7,818±9.6 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The daughter advantage was also observed in parity 2, although the magnitude of the difference was reduced (0.83%; 8,515 vs. 8,445±37 kg, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). These results indicate that the milk production advantage associated with birth of a daughter is not attributable to prevention of dystocia.</p>

        <p>Milk production on first lactation was associated with the sex of the fetus on the second pregnancy because the two overlapped temporally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>Cows (n = 113,750) with both first and second parity lactation records, with no reports of dystocia or bST administration, were used to assess effects of calf sex on milk production in the first 2 lactations.

Means labeled with different letters differ (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and those with common labels do not (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.10). A) First-parity cows having a daughter produced significantly more milk than those having a son, but gestating a daughter in pregnancy 2 increased milk production in cows that had a son first. B) Second-parity milk production is greatest in cows that had a daughter in pregnancy 1. Additionally, cows with a son in pregnancy 1 showed increased milk production if they had a daughter in pregnancy 2.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Holstein dairy cows demonstrate a significant biological effect of sex-biased milk production in favor of daughters. In dairying, calves are removed on the day of birth and standardized mechanical procedures are used for milking, therefore post-natal sex-bias does not explain the results presented here. Instead milk production varied as a function of fetal sex, indicating that functional development of the mammary gland is influenced pre-natally. Importantly, lower milk yield for sons was not compensated by higher protein and fat production; total production of milk energy was greater in cows that gestated daughters. Among rhesus monkeys, mothers rearing daughters produce more milk, but of significantly lower milk energy density- the aggregated calories derived from fat, protein, and sugar- than do mothers of sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>. To our knowledge, the results reported here are the first to document that fetal sex influences milk production. Moreover the effects on milk production were dynamic and persistent across parities. Importantly, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increased milk production across the first two lactations and was protective against the negative effects of male gestation on the second parity. In contrast, gestating a son on the first parity suppressed milk production on the first two lactations, but the conception of a daughter on the second parity partially improved milk production. Nutritional and endocrine conditions <italic>in utero</italic> are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have been less studied.</p>
        <p>Sex-differentiated programming of the mammary gland is further substantiated by the greater effect of bST administration in cows gestating sons than cows gestating daughters. Postnatal administration of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) in multiparous cows overwhelmed the prenatal effects of offspring sex, but had a greater effect in cows gestating sons. Somatotropin, or growth hormone (GH), is produced in the anterior pituitary, stimulated by GH-releasing hormone. Most notably, GH influences metabolism in hepatic and adipose tissues, shunting more maternal bodily reserves to milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers2">[64]</xref>. Insulin-like growth factors are believed to be the major mediators of the effect of GH on the mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bauman1">[60]</xref>, however GH also directly affects the mammary gland and increases milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-PlathGabler1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Johnson1">[66]</xref>. While the mean production parameters increased with the administration of bST for cows producing both daughters and sons, the proportional increase in milk production was greater for multiparous cows gestating sons. Rose and colleagues reported that cows that had low milk yield responses to bST treatment within a herd had greater milk yields before bST treatment compared to cows with a high response in milk yield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rose1">[67]</xref>. This is consistent with our results that cows birthing daughters had elevated milk production and a lower response to exogenous bST administration compared to their counterparts bearing sons. We posit that mechanisms underlying lower initial milk production and greater individual response to bST administration are likely responsible for the greater response to bST in cows with sons. Administration of bST in many ways represents an “experimental” manipulation of mammary gland programming and reveals possible mechanistic pathways through which sex-biases are operating. Although bST was able to overwhelm sex-biased milk synthesis among multiparous cows, significant sex-bias remained among primiparous cows whose mammary glands had functionally developed for the first time in the context of the fetal sex of the first gestation. The magnitude of sex bias is strongest among first parity rhesus monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref> and possibly humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Powe1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Thakkar1">[29]</xref> and Tamar wallabies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Robert1">[31]</xref> in which primiparous females have been disproportionately represented in published studies. The effect of fetal sex may diminish to some extent among multiparous females due to the aggregate effects on mammary gland architecture of sequential gestations of different fetal sexes. Alternatively, maternal investment tactics may change as a function of residual reproductive value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Williams1">[68]</xref> or targeted effort during critical developmental windows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cameron4">[69]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These biological findings may have economic impact for the modern dairy industry. With the widespread availability of sexed-selected semen for use in artificial breeding programs, dairy managers have the option of achieving approximately 90% female pregnancies rather than a natural rate near 47% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>. There are many factors for managers to consider when evaluating the profitability of sexed semen use, including decreased conception rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Norman1">[57]</xref> and increased semen cost. Some published analyses have been skeptical of the economic merit of using sexed semen on dairy operations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Olynk1">[70]</xref>, although the cost of the cell sorting technology continues to drop, making recent analyses more favorable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Ribeiro1">[71]</xref>. Accounting for the impact of a female calf on lactation productivity revealed by our analysis, however, further improves the expected profitability of sexed semen use. It is common to use sexed semen for breeding nulliparous heifers only, and given the long-term impact of a first-parity daughter, the production benefits of this management strategy are substantial. The cumulative increase in milk yield over two lactations for a cow giving birth to a daughter on the first parity rather than consecutive bulls is ∼445 kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0086169-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The impact of sexed semen on the structure of the dairy industry has been a complex question already <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-DeVries1">[72]</xref>, but these results highlight a key factor that has not previously been considered.</p>
        <p>The precise mechanistic pathways through which fetal sex influences mammary gland development remain unknown. Fetal-origin hormones may translocate via maternal circulation to bind directly to receptors in the dam’s mammary gland influencing functional development and subsequent milk synthesis. Among ungulates, ruminants may be especially valuable for understanding mammary gland development during pregnancy as a function of fetal sex because of their cotyledonary placenta. Klisch and Mess posited that for ruminants, an evolutionary “arms race” between the mother and fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Moore1">[73]</xref> for glucose transport, necessitated by the lack of gastrointestinal glucose supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aschenbach1">[74]</xref>, resulted in selective pressure that favored an “inefficient” placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. For example, the placenta of the domestic cow has ∼5 times the surface area as the horse placenta even though the two species produce similarly sized neonates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>. As a byproduct of the greater placental surface area, fetal steroidal hormones can readily diffuse into maternal circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Klisch1">[75]</xref>. Concentrations of estrogens and androgens differ between male and female fetuses and, if in maternal circulation, potentially enhance or inhibit mammary gland development and consequently milk synthesis during lactation. In dairy cows, fetal steroid hormones are present from the first trimester and are critical for the development of fetal sex organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Yang1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Nilsson1">[78]</xref>. Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), another fetal-origin bioactive, increases in maternal circulation across pregnancy in dairy cows gestating sons and decreases in cows gestating daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-AnandIvell1">[79]</xref> but the influences of fetal-origin INSL3 on the mammary gland are not known. Functional development of the mammary gland in taxa characterized by highly invasive hemochorial placentas may also be susceptible to fetal hormones; indeed the majority of reports of sex-biased milk synthesis in the literature are from taxa that have greater placental invasion and/or placental surface area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Rutherford1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Baur1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Capellini1">[80]</xref>. Suggestively, human mothers with higher concentrations of circulating androgens during the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester had a lower probability of sustaining breastfeeding to three months post-partum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Carlsen1">[81]</xref>. The higher circulating androgens may have originated from fetal sons, but the effect of fetal sex was not directly analyzed in that study, nor was milk synthesis measured. Indirectly, fetal sex may influence the production of placental lactogen, a primary hormonal driver of mammary gland development during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Akers1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sternlicht1">[38]</xref> but as of yet differences in placental lactogen as a function of fetal sex have not been reported.</p>
        <p>Daughter-biased milk synthesis may reflect adaptive maternal allocation in response to fetal sex, adaptive fetal manipulation of maternal physiology, or may be a by-product of the maternal-fetal interface. Importantly, uniformly biased milk production in favor of daughters across maternal conditions does not support the Trivers-Willard hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Trivers1">[9]</xref>, or other hypotheses positing facultative sex-biased allocation of resources as a function of maternal condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Cockburn1">[10]</xref>. Dairy cows have a male-biased birth ratio; in the absence of sex-specific artificial insemination, between 50–54% of calves born are male <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-SilvadelRo1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Foote1">[82]</xref>. The mediating effect of maternal condition on birth-sex ratio has been inconsistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Meier1">[83]</xref> as has been the directionality of birth sex-ratio bias. Better-condition cows may produce more sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Roche1">[84]</xref> or daughters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hohenbrink1">[85]</xref>. Integrating the results presented here, dairy cows produce more sons, but seemingly favor daughters with more milk. Mammalian mothers in polygynous taxa may preferentially allocate physiological resources to daughters so that they are able to initiate reproduction at relatively younger ages than do sons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde4">[86]</xref>. For female mammals, because of the temporal constraints of pregnancy and lactation, lifetime reproductive success of daughters will be contingent on the length of their reproductive careers, a function of age at first birth and longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Blomquist1">[87]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Martin1">[88]</xref>. Among sexually dimorphic polygynous taxa, the temporal constraints are relaxed for males, who benefit from growing bigger and stronger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Willisch1">[89]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-FestaBianchet1">[90]</xref>, allowing males more time to compensate for deficits in early life maternal investment before becoming reproductively active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Bercovitch2">[91]</xref>. Daughter-biased milk production may involve life-history tradeoffs for both cows and their daughters. High milk production in dairy cows is generally associated with reduced fertility, health, and survival depending on environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Windig1">[92]</xref>. Moreover daughters gestated during lactation have moderately reduced survival and milk production in their own adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-GonzlezRecio2">[93]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Berry1">[94]</xref>. Although we do not know whether the magnitude of the effects presented here is correlated with such consequences, future research should investigate the fitness effects of daughter-biased milk synthesis both in the short-term (i.e. inter-birth interval), across the lifetime, and inter-generationally.</p>
        <p>The question remains though, under natural conditions how do bull calves grow faster during the post-natal period if their dams are producing less milk, and therefore lower total protein and fat production? One explanation may be that females bias nursing behavior such that milk production is up-regulated for sons, a tactic we could not evaluate in conventional dairying as calves are removed after birth. Landete-Castillejos and colleagues revealed that among captive Iberian red deer, dams rearing sons had greater total milk production and total protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-LandeteCastillejos1">[23]</xref>, possibly due to post-natal hind-calf behavioral dynamics. However in the one study to date of cow maternal behavior, cows do not show any sex biases in nursing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Sthulov1">[18]</xref>. In beef cattle that are reared by their dam, sons are born bigger and have better post-natal growth than do daughters, but only one out of three studies has shown any evidence of male-biased milk synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Minick1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Christian1">[46]</xref>. In the absence of post-natal behavioral modifications of prenatal mammary gland programming, the presence and concentration of other milk bioactives such as immunofactors and hormones that influence offspring development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Neville1">[35]</xref> may differ in milk produced for sons and daughters. Notably, investigations of sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories, however, overwhelmingly essentialize the role of the mother and sex-biased allocation of maternal resources. More often overlooked are sexually differentiated mechanisms within offspring that influence utilization and assimilation of early life nutrition and environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Hinde2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Badyaev1">[95]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0086169-Aiken1">[96]</xref>. Consideration of progeny-specific adaptations as well as biased maternal effort will contribute to a better understanding of the ontogeny of sexual dimorphism.</p>

        <p>The intracellular human protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> uses a novel secreted protein to recruit host mitochondria and alter the host's response to infection.</p>
        </sec></abstract>
        <abstract>
        <p>Recent information has revealed the functional diversity and importance of mitochondria in many cellular processes including orchestrating the innate immune response. Intriguingly, several infectious agents, such as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, <italic>Legionella</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, have been reported to grow within vacuoles surrounded by host mitochondria. Although many hypotheses have been proposed for the existence of host mitochondrial association (HMA), the causes and biological consequences of HMA have remained unanswered. Here we show that HMA is present in type I and III strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> but missing in type II strains, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Analysis of F1 progeny from a type II×III cross revealed that HMA is a Mendelian trait that we could map. We use bioinformatics to select potential candidates and experimentally identify the polymorphic parasite protein involved, mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1). We show that introducing the type I (HMA<sup>+</sup>) <italic>MAF1</italic> allele into type II (HMA<sup>−</sup>) parasites results in conversion to HMA<sup>+</sup> and deletion of <italic>MAF1</italic> in type I parasites results in a loss of HMA. We observe that the loss and gain of HMA are associated with alterations in the transcription of host cell immune genes and the <italic>in vivo</italic> cytokine response during murine infection. Lastly, we use exogenous expression of MAF1 to show that it binds host mitochondria and thus MAF1 is the parasite protein directly responsible for HMA. Our findings suggest that association with host mitochondria may represent a novel means by which <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites manipulate the host. The existence of naturally occurring HMA<sup>+</sup> and HMA<sup>−</sup> strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, <italic>Legionella</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> indicates the existence of evolutionary niches where HMA is either advantageous or disadvantageous, likely reflecting tradeoffs in metabolism, immune regulation, and other functions of mitochondria.</p>

        <abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Recent discoveries have revealed the remarkable functional diversity of mitochondria in roles other than energy production, including an integral role for mitochondria and their dynamics in the regulation of the innate immune response. Interestingly, host mitochondria are recruited to the membranes that surround certain intracellular bacteria and parasites during infection. To date, how and why this phenomenon occurs has been a mystery, although it has been proposed to provide a metabolic benefit to the microbes. Here we identify mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1) as the parasite protein that mediates the association between the protozoan pathogen <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and host mitochondria during infection. We show that MAF1 is needed to recruit host mitochondria to the <italic>Toxoplasma-</italic>containing vacuole and that this process is associated with changes in the immune response in infected cells and animals. These findings show that recruitment and association with host mitochondria is an important means by which intracellular pathogens interface with their host. We also find that the cost–benefit outcome of altering mitochondrial function might differ between strains depending on the precise niche in which they evolved; for infectious agents, these differences likely reflect different host organisms.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that, besides producing energy and regulating apoptotic and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, play a key role in orchestrating several aspects of cell function and behavior including autophagy, apoptosis, and immune signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Hailey1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Bianchi1">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, size, and shape, are linked to altered regulation of certain innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Scorrano2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Campello1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given this diversity of function, it is no surprise that mitochondria have recently emerged as central to host–pathogen interactions, with an increasing number of viruses and bacteria having been shown to manipulate host mitochondria in their roles in apoptosis, energy production, and immune function. For example, the hepatitis C virus protease NS3/4a cleaves the N-terminal fragment of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), rendering infected cells unable to induce interferon (IFN) production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Meylan1">[6]</xref>, and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) engages the machinery involved in regulation of mitochondrial fission to induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Jain1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In light of these newly established roles for mitochondria and their targeting by different microbial effector proteins, it is interesting that during infection with certain pathogens host mitochondria associate with and appear sequestered at the vacuole in which the microbes reside. This phenomenon has been previously reported during infection with the bacteria <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Horwitz1">[8]</xref> and <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Matsumoto1">[9]</xref> and the parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Jones1">[10]</xref>, and this occurs both in mammalian (<italic>T. gondii</italic>, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, and <italic>C. psittaci</italic>) and protozoan host cells (<italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in <italic>Hartmannella vermiforis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-AbuKwaik1">[11]</xref>). Although the mechanism and functional consequence of this association during infection with these bacteria remain unknown, it has been reported that this association is species-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Matsumoto1">[9]</xref>—for example, <italic>C. psittaci</italic>, but not <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, intimately associates with mitochondria. In the case of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, three predominant, clonal lineages have been described based on genotyping performed on isolates from human and animal infections in North America and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Howe1">[12]</xref>. Referred to as type I, type II, and type III, these lineages differ widely in a number of phenotypes including migratory capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Barragan1">[13]</xref>, cytokine production in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Rosowski1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Saeij1">[15]</xref>, and virulence in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Grigg1">[16]</xref>. Whether these lineages also differ in their ability to recruit host mitochondria, however, has not previously been assessed.</p>
        <p>Since the initial discovery of host mitochondrial association (HMA) in macrophages infected with (type I) <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites in 1972 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Jones1">[10]</xref>, the question of what parasite factor mediates this association has been of intense interest. Previous work suggested that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> HMA was mediated by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> rhoptry protein 2 (ROP2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Sinai1">[17]</xref>. However, subsequent work showed that parasites lacking ROP2 expression were indistinguishable from wild-type parasites in their ability to recruit host mitochondria, reopening the question of what factors mediated the association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Pernas1">[18]</xref>. The functional significance of the recruitment of mitochondria to the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> vacuole also remained a conundrum. Although HMA has long been assumed to reflect a crucial means by which the parasite acquires key metabolites, only limited evidence has emerged to support this hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Crawford1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Schwartzman1">[20]</xref>. Given our expanded understanding of the diverse roles performed by mitochondria, however, we hypothesized that HMA confers a selective advantage to the various infectious agents where it has been described and that mitochondrial functions other than metabolism might also contribute to this advantage.</p>
        <p>Here, we report that HMA is strain-specific in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and that it is mediated by a novel, secreted parasite factor, mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1), which differs in sequence, gene copy number, and expression between the three canonical strains. We demonstrate that MAF1 is necessary and sufficient for HMA and go on to show that during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, HMA is associated, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with substantially altered levels of cytokines. These results demonstrate that HMA is an additional means by which <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites interface with the immune signaling of the host and suggest that, in addition to possible metabolic roles, HMA may present a novel strategy for subversion of host immune signaling by a pathogen.</p>

        <title><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Association with Host Mitochondria Is Strain-Specific</title>
        <p>Given that the three predominant strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> differ widely in a number of immune-related phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Saeij2">[21]</xref> and that mitochondria have recently been shown to play a key role in orchestrating the cellular immune response to viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-West1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Arnoult1">[23]</xref>, we hypothesized that HMA might differ between these canonical strains. To investigate this possibility, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were labeled with MitoTracker and infected with representative type I (RH), type II (Me49), or type III (CEP) strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. At 4 h postinfection (hpi), the type I and III tachyzoites showed the canonical, intimate, and extensive association of host mitochondria at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM)–host interface, whereas type II parasites showed little if any HMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). To quantify and expand on these findings, the percentage of the PVM associated with host cell mitochondria was measured in electron micrographs of HFFs 4 hpi with type I, II, and III parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g001">Figure 1D–F</xref>). The results showed that ∼35% and ∼18% of the PVM is tightly associated with host cell mitochondria in type I and III strains, respectively, in contrast to &lt;2% of the PVM in infections with type II parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Although host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has also been reported to associate with the PVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Sinai2">[24]</xref>, the abundance and size of the ER meant we were unable to confidently assess or quantify such association and so cannot comment on which strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> do or do not exhibit this trait.</p>

        <p>To ensure the generality of the HMA<sup>−</sup> phenotype in type II strains, HMA was also assessed in an independent type II strain, Pru, which was isolated in France (Me49 was isolated in the United States of America); Pru was also found to be HMA<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s001">Figure S1</xref>), demonstrating that the HMA<sup>−</sup> phenotype is not an isolate-specific property of Me49. Similarly, to determine whether HMA differed among cell lines of different mammalian and tissue origins, we tested the phenotype in murine macrophages and Madin–Darby canine kidney cells and obtained the same results as in the HFFs: type II was consistently HMA<sup>−</sup>, whereas types I and III were HMA<sup>+</sup> (unpublished data). To determine if HMA occurs during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were isolated from mice infected with type I and type II parasites and processed for electron microscopy analysis. Quantification of HMA in infected PECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s002">Figure S2</xref>) confirmed that HMA occurs in animals infected with type I but not type II strains.

We sought to test our hypothesis that strain-specific HMA had a genetic basis by utilizing F<sub>1</sub> progeny from a type II×III cross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Pfefferkorn1">[26]</xref>, as these lineages differ in their ability to recruit mitochondria and their progeny have been previously genotyped at 135 different markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Khan1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To facilitate HMA screening in the F1 progeny, we first determined whether co-infection with an HMA<sup>−</sup> strain and HMA<sup>+</sup> strain could alter the HMA phenotype of either parasite. The results showed that co-infection of HFFs with strains that differ in HMA did not affect the phenotype: type II parasites were within HMA<sup>−</sup> vacuoles, whereas types I and III showed efficient HMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To reliably determine the HMA phenotype of the F1 progeny, therefore, HFFs were co-infected with each of the 34 F<sub>1</sub> progeny and a GFP expressing HMA<sup>+</sup> control. This allowed for a direct comparison and qualitative assessment of the HMA phenotype between each progeny and the HMA<sup>+</sup> control within the same cell. In all, 15 progeny were HMA<sup>−</sup>, 18 were HMA<sup>+</sup>, and one was indeterminate; example HMA<sup>+</sup> and HMA<sup>−</sup> progeny are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, respectively.

        <p>To choose among the list of 153 genes present in the region identified on chromosome II as possibly involved in HMA, we used a candidate gene approach based on properties predicted for the parasite factor. HMA occurs at the PVM and is strain-specific; thus, we used bioinformatics to first identify genes that encoded a predicted signal peptide and a transmembrane (TM) domain, and had different expression levels between HMA<sup>+</sup> (types I and III) and HMA<sup>−</sup> (type II) strains.

        <p>To determine if the protein encoded by <italic>TGGT1_053770</italic> traffics to the PVM, a property expected of a protein mediating HMA, HFFs were infected with type I parasites engineered to ectopically express an N-terminally HA-tagged version of the protein driven by its own promoter and with the HA-tag placed just downstream of the putative signal peptide. Using anti-HA antibody, the tagged protein was indeed found to localize at the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This localization was confirmed by raising antibodies to recombinant TGGT1_053770 and showing that these antibodies likewise stained the PVM of cells infected with type I parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). There was near-perfect co-localization of the anti-HA antibodies and anti-TGGT1_053770 antibodies in cells infected with type I parasites expressing <italic>TGGT1_053770</italic>, showing that the N-terminal tagging did not detectably alter the protein's trafficking in the infected cells (unpublished data). Given that the PVM and intracellular staining pattern was consistent with that of a dense granular protein, we also looked with antibodies to dense granule protein 7 (GRA7) and anti-HA antibodies and found that there was co-localization between these two proteins in extracellular parasites expressing the <italic>TGGT1_053770</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g003">Figure 3H</xref>); hence, <italic>TGGT_053770</italic> appears to encode a dense granule protein.</p>
        <p>To compare expression of this locus between the archetypal strains, Western blot analysis of extracellular lysates of type I, II, and III tachyzoites was performed using anti-TGGT1_053770 antibodies. The results showed that although expression levels were comparable in HMA<sup>+</sup> type I and III parasites (albeit the type III protein migrates slightly but reproducibly more slowly), type II parasites showed no detectable expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), consistent with the microarray data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g003">Figure 3D</xref>. To determine if this failure to detect a signal in lysates from type II parasites might be due to a gross difference between the allele in this strain relative to TGGT1_053770, we PCR-amplified and sequenced the locus from RH (type I) and Me49 (type II) genomic DNA. Although the tandem duplications of this locus make it difficult to determine the true extent of sequence variation within and between strains, the results showed a 94.5% predicted amino acid identity between the two types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s005">Figure S5</xref>), making it very unlikely that polyclonal antisera raised to one would not react with the other.</p>
        <p>Collectively, the data above indicate that <italic>TGGT1_053770</italic> has the expected properties of a parasite mediator of HMA in being a tandemly repeated locus that differs in sequence, copy number, and expression between strains and that encodes a novel dense granule phosphoprotein found at the PVM.</p>

        <p>To directly test the hypothesis that TGGT1_053770 mediates HMA, we infected HFFs with type II parasites or type II parasites engineered to express the N-terminally HA-tagged type I allele of this gene (referred to here as type II:<italic>MAF1</italic>). At 12 hpi, cells were fixed and stained with anti-TGGT1_053770 polyclonal sera along with antibodies to Translocase of the Outer Membrane 20 (TOM20), a marker of host mitochondria. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) showed that expression of TGGT1_053770 in type II tachyzoites is associated with a dramatic gain in HMA, with the recruited mitochondria being specifically associated with the portions of the PVM that stained with anti-TGGT1_053770. Electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) confirmed that the HMA<sup>+</sup> phenotype of type II:<italic>TGGT1_053770</italic> parasites results in a marked increase in the levels of mitochondrial recruitment; on average, ∼30% of the PVM surface appears associated with host mitochondria when infecting with these parasites compared to &lt;2% with type II parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

Electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) was used to quantify the difference in HMA: only ∼3% of the PVMs surrounding type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> were associated with host mitochondria, in contrast to ∼35% for type I PVMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

        <title>Exposure of the C-Terminus of MAF1 Is Essential for Its Role in HMA</title>
        <p>Although BLAST searches yielded no clues as to the coding function or region of MAF1 responsible for HMA, we hypothesized that during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection the predicted TM domain anchors MAF1 at the PVM, allowing for the MAF1 C-terminal domain to be exposed to the host cell cytosol, where it tethers host mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, type II parasites were engineered to express MAF1 bearing a C-terminal HA epitope tag (MAF1_CHA). The HA tag served a dual purpose: to allow for recognition of the expressed transgene as well as function as a steric block if an exposed C-terminus is necessary for HMA. The results showed that the type II:<italic>MAF1_CHA</italic> parasites remain HMA<sup>−</sup>, suggesting a native C-terminus is necessary for MAF1 function (unpublished data). Surprisingly, in type I parasites engineered to express <italic>MAF1_CHA</italic>, the C-terminally HA-tagged MAF1 acts as a dominant negative; its expression results in a dramatic loss of HMA at 4 hpi even though it correctly localizes to the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). These data suggest that the C-terminal domain of MAF1 is key to its role in HMA, although we cannot exclude an indirect effect of the C-terminal epitope tag.</p>

        <title>MAF1 Induces Changes in Mitochondrial Morphology and Is Associated with an Altered Host Cell Response to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic></title>
        <p>The identification of MAF1 as the molecule that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> uses to mediate HMA enabled us to next address the functional consequences of HMA in the host–pathogen interaction. HMA has been hypothesized to serve as a source of metabolites for the parasite, and previous work has shown that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> scavenges host-derived mitochondrial lipoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Crawford1">[19]</xref>. To determine the role of HMA during tachyzoite growth within a host cell, type I versus type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> proliferation was compared in a competitive growth assay in HFFs <italic>in vitro</italic>. At 7–10 d postinfection (dpi), we observed no significant growth disadvantage in type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> parasites due to the loss of HMA. A similar comparison of growth of type II versus type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> parasites also yielded no reproducible change in their relative numbers 7–10 dpi (unpublished data). Collectively, these data support the conclusion that HMA does not result in growth differences between type I and type II parasites in a nutritionally replete environment, although this does not exclude a metabolic role for HMA.</p>
        <p>As previously mentioned, HMA occurs during infection with the vacuolar pathogens <italic>C. psittaci</italic> and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. To address the consideration that HMA represents a conserved host response to vacuolar pathogens and might be the result of toll-like receptor (TLR) or IFN-dependent signaling, we infected bone marrow isolated from MyD88<sup>−/−</sup>, IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup>, and wild-type mice with type I and type II parasites (MyD88 is a common part of the signaling pathway for many TLRs, and IFNAR is the shared receptor used by type I IFNs). Electron microscopy showed no differences in HMA in these mutant bone marrow cells relative to wild-type cells (unpublished data). Given our growing understanding of how different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains vary in their interaction with the host, we hypothesized that HMA might be involved in the strain-specific ability of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to alter innate immune signaling in infected host cells. Interestingly, early observations of HMA described the presence of “giant mitochondria” at the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> PVM during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Endo1">[35]</xref>, and more recently, the proteins that regulate mitochondrial morphology have been found to play a crucial role in modulating cellular immune signaling during viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Onoguchi1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Yasukawa1">[38]</xref>. To determine if HMA results in morphological differences in the associated host mitochondria, the average sizes of unassociated (cytosolic) mitochondria and PVM-associated mitochondria in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs) infected with type I parasites were measured in electron micrographs. The analysis was also done during type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> infection for confirmation. The results showed that in mBMDMs infected with type I or type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> parasites, the average cross-sectional area of a PVM-associated mitochondrion is approximately 3-fold greater than the average for cytosolic mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

        <p>Previous work has shown that signaling through the mitochondrion can alter transcription of proinflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Seth1">[39]</xref>. To investigate the role of HMA in the immune response to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional profiles of MEFs 8 hpi with type II and type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> parasites. The microarray analysis revealed that the expression of several chemokines and IFN-gamma-induced genes differed significantly in a MAF1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and that three of the greatest transcriptional changes were seen for the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL2, CSF2, and IL6, with respective increases in expression in the type II:<italic>MAF1</italic>–infected cells of ∼4.6-, 4.8-, and 5-fold. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that canonical immune pathways, including JAK-STAT, NFAT, and IL10, were among the most significantly enriched gene sets up-regulated during type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> infection relative to type II wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that MAF1 mediates these effects independent of its role in HMA, these data suggest that HMA in type II parasites has a significant impact on the host cell's transcriptional response to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, especially in terms of innate immune signaling.</p>
        <p>To explore this issue further, levels of 26 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured from supernatants of mBMDMs 3 hpi and 17 hpi with type II and type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> parasites using the Luminex Mouse 26-plex (Meso Scale Discovery, services rendered by Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center). mBMDMs were used because monocytes have been shown to account for approximately 60% of infected cells during a peritoneal infection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and are required for immunity to this parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Mordue1">[40]</xref>. At 3 hpi, no significant differences were seen between type II and type II:<italic>MAF1</italic>–infected mBMDMs (unpublished data), whereas at 17 hpi, we observed increased secretion of IL6 and IL10 and the proinflammatory chemokines RANTES (CCL5) and the murine IL-8 homologue KC (CXCL1) in cells infected with type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Together, these results argue for a key role for HMA in modulation of the innate immune response during infection.</p>

        <title>Loss of HMA Is Associated with Serum Cytokine Changes <italic>in Vivo</italic></title>
        <p>We and others have previously shown that type I parasites generate a profoundly different immunological response compared with type II parasites, which activate NF-κB and result in increased IL-12 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Rosowski1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Saeij1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Robben1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Kim1">[42]</xref>. To avoid the possibility that the impact of type II on other immune pathways might interfere with our interpretation of the results, we addressed whether the loss of HMA in its natural context (type I background) impacted infection <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic>. To test this, WT MEFs were infected with type I and type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> parasites, and at 8 hpi, the RNA was isolated and processed for microarray analysis. Interestingly, unlike the 231 genes differentially regulated between type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> and type II infection, only eight genes were observed to be significantly induced in a MAF1-dependent manner during type I infection, including SerpinB2 and IL-11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s008">Figure S8</xref>); the increased expression of SerpinB2 and IL-11 receptor alpha (IL-11rap) was also MAF1-dependent during type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and might represent part of a HMA-induced signaling pathway in host cells.</p>
        <p>To address whether the loss of HMA in the type I background impacted virulence in the murine host, we compared lethality following intraperitoneal infection of C57/BL6 mice with type I and type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> tachyzoites and observed no differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This was expected, as previous analyses of the same II×III F<sub>1</sub> progeny used to map HMA, as well as crosses of type I with types II and III, showed no indication of a significant mouse-virulence trait on chromosome II, the MAF1-encoding chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Saeij3">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Behnke1">[45]</xref>. Although our results confirm that <italic>MAF1</italic> is not a major virulence determinant using the crude measure of mortality by intraperitoneal infection in mice, they did not address the possibility of other differences in the host response to infection by type I and type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> parasites. To test for such effects, PECs were isolated from mice 5 dpi with type I or type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> tachyzoites and their cytokine production assessed on the Luminex platform at 6 h and 12 h postisolation. The results showed differences (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in two cytokines, IL4 and eotaxin, and interestingly, both were present at lower levels in cultured supernatant of PECs from the type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic>–infected mice compared to mice infected with type I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) parasites. To test the effect on the animal as a whole, sera from similarly infected mice were also analyzed 5 dpi. We observed that, as with IL4 and eotaxin secretion from isolated PECs, 14 of the 26 cytokines examined were present at lower levels in mice infected with type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> relative to type I parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These differences included IL6, IL10, and RANTES (CCL5), which were increased in a MAF1-dependent manner during type II versus type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> infections in mBMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To determine if the differential cytokine production observed was a result of differences in parasite burden, mice were infected with RFP-expressing type I and type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> tachyzoites. At 5 dpi, the same time point used for the sera analyses, PECs were isolated and analyzed for RFP expression using flow cytometry and shown to exhibit comparable parasite levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001845-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, although the <italic>MAF1</italic> genotype appears to have no effect on lethality or parasite burden during the acute stages of an i.p. infection, these results suggest some role for MAF1 in modulating the immune response and support for the notion that HMA is a novel strategy by which an intracellular pathogen can interfere with host signaling.</p>

        <title>Recruitment of Host Mitochondria Is Strain-Specific</title>
        <p>It is well known that the three archetypal <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains that dominate in Europe and North America differ in several important host interactions including the ability to inactivate mouse immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) that otherwise attack the PVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Fentress1">[47]</xref> and to phosphorylate host signal-transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Ong1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Yamamoto1">[49]</xref>. We show that HMA is yet another dramatic way in which the three dominant genotypes differ and so is part of a complicated calculus in the parasite's evolution with the optimal solution (HMA<sup>+</sup> or HMA<sup>−</sup>) likely depending on the interplay with other factors. For example, it could be that there are strain-specific differences in the need for host metabolites produced by the mitochondria (e.g., lipoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Crawford1">[19]</xref>) and/or susceptibility to the damage mitochondrial metabolites can cause (e.g., reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-West2">[50]</xref>). Of note, type II strains but not types I and III encode a version of the soluble factor, GRA15, that stimulates NF-κB production in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Rosowski1">[14]</xref>. It may be that a combination of HMA and NF-κB stimulation would be suboptimal to the parasite compared to either on its own, but the extraordinary success of type II in certain regions of the world clearly indicates that this strain is well optimized for at least some niche. It is also possible that the function served by HMA in types I and III is provided by a completely different mechanism in type II, but until that function is known, this is difficult to speculate about.</p>
        <p>Most models predict that different traits evolved in certain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains because of their interaction with a particular host species or host state. IRGs, for example, are crucial parts of the immune armamentarium in mice but are functionally lacking in primates, possibly explaining the polymorphisms seen in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors, ROP5 and ROP18, that neutralize them. MAF1, like ROP5 or ROP18, may have evolved as a crucial defense to the immune response in a specific host. We note that the dramatic difference in murine fibroblast transcription observed in type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> versus type II infection was not observed in type I versus type I:<italic>Δmaf1</italic> infection. This is likely due to the very different host responses seen in cells infected with type I versus type II parasites. We saw no difference in HMA in the three species of host cells examined (human, mouse, and dog), but we cannot exclude that some untested host exists where type II tachyzoites do show HMA, although this would likely require host-specific activation of transcription from the <italic>MAF1</italic> locus given that <italic>MAF1</italic> expression in type II parasites is essentially quiescent when grown <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
        <p>The genes responsible for the HMA seen during <italic>Legionella</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection have not yet been identified, but no <italic>MAF1</italic> homologue is seen in their respective genomes by BLAST analysis (unpublished data).

        <p>Although these results demonstrate that MAF1 directly binds host mitochondria and is crucial for HMA, they do not make any prediction as to the mitochondrial binding partner and whether HMA is directly responsible for the observed alterations in the morphology of the associated mitochondria. No other molecule has been described with the ability to mediate HMA, and the sequence of MAF1 did not provide any obvious clues to mechanism. Previous models involving ROP2 as the mediator of HMA proposed that a mitochondrial import signal on the protein's N-terminus is recognized by the import machinery on the mitochondria, and an incomplete, stalled uptake of the protein results in HMA. This exact mechanism seems unlikely given that the MAF1 C-terminus appears to play a key role, as seen by the inability of the MAF1_CHA construct to mediate HMA, but our results would be consistent with a model involving uptake of C-terminal import signals as shown for the yeast DNA helicase Hmi1P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Lee1">[52]</xref>.

        <title>How Does HMA Result in Changes in the Host Immune Response?</title>
        <p>Mitochondria act as a nexus for a wide range of host cellular processes and signaling networks including chemotaxis, calcium signaling, apoptosis, and immune signaling. It has been previously reported that during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, over one-third of all modulated host proteins are mitochondrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Nelson1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Kumar1">[54]</xref>, a significant enrichment considering mitochondrial proteins are predicted to account for only 4.25% of the cell proteome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Kumar1">[54]</xref>. This is consistent with HMA having a profound effect on mitochondria during a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, similar to what has been reported during bacterial and viral infections where substantial changes are observed in mitochondrial morphology and outer mitochondrial membrane composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-West2">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Ohta1">[55]</xref>. Our results on the increased cross-sectional area of PVM-associated mitochondria also suggest HMA affects their physiology, although we have not directly assessed this in our experiments here.</p>
        <p>The identification of the key protein mediating HMA allowed us to show that this phenomenon is associated with a significant alteration of transcription of host cell immune genes. We do not know the mechanism by which HMA results in the transcriptional responses or cytokine responses observed, or whether it is directly responsible for these changes. It is well known, however, that during viral infection, signaling through MAVS results in recruitment of cytosolic factors to the outer mitochondrial membrane; activation of different transcription factors including NF-kB, IRF3, and IRF7; and subsequent production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Seth1">[39]</xref>. Although there was a significant enrichment for genes with NF-kB binding sites in their promoters by Transcription Binding Site analysis of the microarray data during type II:<italic>MAF1</italic> infection of mBMDMs (unpublished data), there was no evidence for IRF3 or IRF7 activation. Interestingly, although the absence of MAVS did not appear to affect HMA in type I–infected cells, five of the eight genes whose induction or repression was MAF1-dependent in MEFs during type I infection were also MAVS-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001845.s008">Figure S8</xref>). These include SerpinB2 and TSG14 (tumor necrosis factor–inducible gene 14) but not, however, IL11, suggesting MAVS may play some role in MAF1-induced immune changes in the host cell.</p>
        <p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that MAF1 is mediating the observed transcriptional and immune responses independently of HMA, we hypothesize that type I and III <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> co-opt mitochondrial signaling using HMA to generate a cytokine milieu conducive to parasite survival and efficient dissemination. Interestingly, the cytokines whose levels were increased in HMA<sup>+</sup> strains during mBMDM infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and in PECS <italic>ex vivo</italic>, including IL6, CCL5, and IL10, are not those that would be expected to change based on interference with known mitochondrial signaling pathways (i.e., MAVS, NF-kB, IRF3/7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-West1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Arnoult1">[23]</xref>). These data suggest that HMA might be functioning through a yet unidentified pathway linking mitochondria and innate immune signaling, further highlighting the connection between mitochondria and immunity. It is possible that the observed changes in mitochondrial morphology reflect this manipulation, as it has previously been shown that the machinery that regulates mitochondrial fission and fusion (e.g., Mitofusin 1 and 2) are also necessary in the signaling cascades that result during viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Castanier1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001845-Yasukawa1">[38]</xref>. Future work will be required to map out the pathways that link HMA to the observed differences in cytokine responses, as well as to determine how the consequences of HMA impact the host–parasite interaction. Our identification of strain-specific differences in HMA during infection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and the molecular basis underlying those differences provides a model that can be used to dissect the biological role of HMA and the possibly novel ways by which mitochondria engage immune-signaling pathways.</p>

Following incubation, blots were washed three times in PBS-T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies at a 1∶2,500 dilution. The membrane was stripped (Invitrogen stripping buffer) and reprobed with rabbit anti-SAG1 antibody at a 1∶100,000 dilution in blocking solution for 1 h. After three PBS-T washes, the blot was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies at a 1∶3,000 dilution and developed using a chemiluminescence system (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). For assessing phosphorylation, lysates from extracellular type I parasites and type I–infected HFFs (intracellular) were treated with and without calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) for 1 h and loaded in each lane.

        \     <p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum
        of liver diseases, ranging from simple steatosis through nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
        (NASH) to cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely associated with features of the metabolic
        syndrome, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
        NAFLD is therefore considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic
        syndrome <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Marchesini1\">[1]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Marchesini2\">[2]</xref>.</p>\n
        \     <p>Growth hormone (GH) originates from the anterior pituitary gland
        and is an important regulator of nutritional metabolism and body composition.
        Low GH secretion from the pituitary is associated with increased visceral
        body fat and other features of the metabolic syndrome. For example, in a previous
        study, patients with GH deficiency had significance higher body mass index
        (BMI) and waist circumference, and elevated serum total cholesterol, low-density
        lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides than the controls <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Hong1\">[3]</xref>. Adult patients with GH deficiency also
        had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome than the controls <xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Attanasio1\">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Di1\">[5]</xref>. GH therapy decreased the prevalence of
        the metabolic syndrome and improved metabolic status <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Pasarica1\">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Follin1\">[7]</xref>.</p>\n
        \     <p>Some studies have noted the high prevalence of NAFLD in GH deficiency.
        Ichikawa <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Ichikawa1\">[8]</xref>
        reported that in patients with adult onset anterior lobe pituitary hormone
        deficiency (with or without GH deficiency), NAFLD was more frequently observed
        in patients with GH deficiency. Decreased GH levels were also associated with
        the severity of hepatic steatosis in other studies <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Hong1\">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Ichikawa2\">[9]</xref>.
        Furthermore, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction may be accompanied by progressive
        NAFLD and excessive weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Adams1\">[10]</xref>. However,
        Gardner <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Gardner1\">[11]</xref>
        recently reported that there was no significant difference in the incidence
        of NAFLD between GH deficiency and the controls. The sample sizes of these
        studies were small and the study subjects were almost all patients with hypothalamic/pituitary
        illness.</p>\n      <p>So far, the association between GH levels and NAFLD
        among the general population remains unclear. The aim of this study was to
        investigate the association between the GH levels and NAFLD in a large population
        survey.</p>\n    </sec>\n    <sec id=\"s2\" sec-type=\"materials|methods\">\n

        evaluate the relationship between serum GH levels and NAFLD, a cross-sectional
        study was conducted among the employees of Zhenhai Refining &amp; Chemical
        Company Ltd. (Ningbo, China). These employees were enrolled at the time of
        their annual health examination between March 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009.
        The majority of these subjects had taken part in our other studies <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Li1\">[12]</xref>. The following individuals were excluded
        from the study, based on medical history and self-reported medication use:
        (1) those with excessive alcohol consumption (more than 140 g/week for men
        and 70 g/week for women) (n = 697); (2) those with a history of viral hepatitis,
        autoimmune hepatitis, or other liver disease (n = 797); and (3) those taking
        antihypertensive, antidiabetic agents, or lipid-lowering agents (n = 702).
        A total of 7146 subjects were enrolled (4622 men and 2524 women; mean age
        of 45.8±15.1 years and 49.4±13.2 years, respectively).</p>\n      </sec>\n
        \     <sec id=\"s2c\">\n        <title>Data Collection</title>\n        <p>All
        subjects underwent a clinical examination, which included a medical history
        and health habit inventory taken by a physician, anthropometric measurements,
        hepatic ultrasonic examination, and biochemical measurements. The examinations
        were administered in the morning. The subjects had been instructed to fast
        for at least 12 hours prior to the examination and to refrain from exercise
        during the day before their examination. Blood pressure was measured using
        an automated sphygmomanometer with the subject in a sitting position. Systolic
        blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were measured at the first and
        fifth Korotkoff phases, respectively. Mean arterial pressure was calculated
        as diastolic blood pressure plus one-third pulse pressure. Pulse pressure
        was defined as the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
        Standing height and body weight were measured without shoes or outer clothing.
        BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
        (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Waist circumference was measured with the measuring tape
        positioned midway between the lowest rib and the superior border of the iliac
        crest as the subject exhaled normally.</p>\n        <p>Fasting blood samples
        were obtained from an antecubital vein of each subject in the morning, and
        the samples were used for the analysis of biochemical values. The values included
        alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), triglycerides,
        total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and
        LDL-C, respectively), and fasting blood glucose. All values were measured
        with an Olympus AU640 autoanalyzer (Olympus, Kobe, Japan) using standard methods.
        The serum GH levels were determined via a protein chip-chemiluminescence system
        (HealthDigit, Shanghai, China).</p>\n        <p>The diagnosis of hepatic steatosis
        was based on the liver ultrasound performed with a 3.5-MHz transducer (Nemio
        20, Toshiba, Japan). A trained ultrasonographist who was blinded to the clinical
        and laboratory data carried out the ultrasound examination. Hepatic steatosis
        was diagnosed according to characteristic echo patterns, such as diffuse hyperechogenicity
        of the liver relative to the kidneys, ultrasound beam attenuation, and poor
        visualization of intrahepatic structures <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Targher1\">[13]</xref>.

        logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between

        circumference, mean arterial pressure, ALT, GGT, total cholesterol, triglycerides,
        HDL-C, LDL-C, fasting plasma glucose, and GH were entered into the original

        circumference, ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose
        were significantly and positively associated with NAFLD; while HDL-C and GH
        were inversely correlated with NAFLD (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"pone-0044136-t003\">Table
        3</xref>).</p>\n        <p>To further analyze the relationship between NAFLD
        and GH levels, subjects with serum GH levels &lt;0.07 ng/mL were defined as
        the lower GH group and those with serum GH levels ≥0.07 ng/mL were defined
        as the higher GH group (0.07 ng/mL was the median GH concentration). NAFLD
        was more prevalent in the lower GH group (28.8%), compared with the higher
        GH group (17.2%; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 134.4, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).
        Similarly, the metabolic syndrome was more prevalent in the lower GH group
        (14.5%), compared with the higher GH group (9.5%; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 40.9,
        <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). In addition, the lower GH group had higher prevalence
        of metabolic syndrome features (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0044136-g001\">Figure

        \     <p>In the present cross-sectional study of 7146 individuals, serum GH
        levels were significantly associated with the prevalence of NAFLD and the
        metabolic syndrome. NAFLD subjects had lower GH levels, and the prevalence
        of NAFLD negatively correlated with GH levels. We also observed that GH levels
        were inversely correlated with the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, the stepwise
        multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant link between lower
        serum GH levels and the risk factor of NAFLD.</p>\n      <p>GH deficiency
        and the metabolic syndrome share many similar features, including abdominal/visceral
        obesity, insulin resistance, premature atherosclerosis, and increased mortality
        from cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Johannsson1\">[17]</xref>.
        Adults with little or no detectable GH also often have a higher BMI, waist
        circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, cholesterol, and other
        metabolic disorders <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Hong1\">[3]</xref>.
        NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and its higher
        prevalence among GH-deficient adults has already been noted <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Hong1\">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Ichikawa1\">[8]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Adams1\">[10]</xref>. These findings
        are in agreement with the results of the present study, in that the prevalence
        rate of NAFLD was higher in those subjects with GH levels &lt;0.07 ng/mL than
        in those whose GH levels were higher. Meanwhile, NAFLD subjects also had lower
        GH levels in our study. This is consistent with the report of Fusco <italic>et
        al.</italic> <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Fusco1\">[18]</xref>,
        who found after growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and arginine stimulation
        tests that NAFLD patients had lower peak levels of serum GH and insulin-like
        growth factor (IGF1), and higher levels of serum GH-binding protein (GHBP)
        and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3).</p>\n      <p>However,
        a recent small sample case-control study showed that GH deficiency patients
        did not have a higher incidence of hepatic steatosis compared to age-and BMI-matched
        controls <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Gardner1\">[11]</xref>.
        In that study, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS)
        was used to diagnose hepatic steatosis, which is a more sensitive technique
        than computed tomography or ultrasonography. Therefore, further research is
        required to clarify the complex relationship between GH, hepatic steatosis,
        and the metabolic syndrome.</p>\n      <p>While the above has argued that
        the association between lower GH levels and NAFLD was due to the latter’s
        status as the metabolic syndrome component, it may be more probable that insulin
        resistance is the link between GH and NAFLD. Insulin resistance has a central
        role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and low GH level is also associated with
        insulin resistance. Insulin can directly suppress GH secretion from the pituitary
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Melmed1\">[19]</xref>, while more
        severe insulin resistance may impair GHRH and the arginine-induced GH response
        in NAFLD patients <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Misra1\">[20]</xref>.</p>\n
        \     <p>Furthermore, inflammation is characteristic of the pathological progression
        of NAFLD <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Tarantino1\">[21]</xref>,
        and GH deficiency often leads to an inflammatory process; GH deficient adults
        were reported to have higher levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
        protein and tumor necrosis factor <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Lanes1\">[22]</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Utz1\">[23]</xref>. In addition,
        oxidative stress is another important feature of the pathogenesis of NAFLD
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Gambino1\">[24]</xref>, and lower
        GH levels often accompany oxidative stress. Increased levels of oxidative
        stress were observed in the serum and liver of a GH-deficient patient, it
        was decreased after GH-replacement therapy <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Takahashi1\">[25]</xref>.
        Other investigations also showed that GH had an antioxidant role <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"pone.0044136-Ungvari1\">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Qin1\">[27]</xref>.</p>\n
        \     <p>Regrettably, our present cross-sectional study did not establish
        a cause for the association between low GH levels and NAFLD. The study’s findings
        were also limited in that NAFLD was diagnosed solely by ultrasonographic methods,
        which cannot distinguish NASH from simple steatosis. Nevertheless, ultrasonography
        is widely used for population-based studies, with reasonable accuracy <xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0044136-Angulo1\">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, our
        initial study design did not allow for the examination of insulin levels and
        insulin resistance, although insulin resistance may be an important link between
        low GH levels and NAFLD. For the same reason, IGF-1 was not examined; this
        hampers our complete understanding of the association between NAFLD and the
        GH/IGF-1 axis. Moreover, the secretion of GH is pulsatile, a single measurement
        of serum GH level may not adequate to reflect true 24h GH levels. Finally,
        inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor were
        not measured, which could provide important information regarding the association
        between GH levels and NAFLD.</p>\n      <p>In conclusion, in this cross-section
        study we found that low serum GH levels were significantly associated with
        NAFLD. This suggests that GH might play an important role in the diagnosis
        and physio-pathological process of NAFLD.</p>\n    </sec>\n  </body>\n  <back>\n

        <abstract>
        <p>Embryo implantation is an essential step for the establishment of pregnancy and dynamically regulated by estrogen and progesterone. NDRG4 (N-myc down-regulated gene 4) is a tumor suppressor that participates in cell survival, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to preliminarily explore the role of NDRG4 in embryo implantation. By immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that uterine expression of NDRG4 was increased along with puberal development, and its expression in adult females reached the peak at the estrus stage during the estrus cycle. Furthermore, uterine NDRG4 expression was significantly induced by the treatment of estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) both in pre-puberty females and ovariectomized adult females. Uterine expression pattern of NDRG4 during the peri-implantation period in mice was determined by IHC, qRT-PCR and Western blot. It was observed that NDRG4 expression was up-regulated during the implantation process, and its expression level at the implantation sites was significantly higher than that at the inter-implantation sites. Meanwhile, an increased expression in NDRG4 was associated with artificial decidualization as well as the activation of delayed implantation. By qRT-PCR and Western blot, we found that the <italic>in vitro</italic> decidualization of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) was accompanied by up-regulation of NDRG4 expression, whereas knockdown of its expression in these cells by siRNA inhibited the decidualization process. In addition, Western blot analysis showed that NDRG4 protein expression was decreased in human villus tissues of recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients compared to normal pregnant women. Collectively, these data suggested that uterine NDRG4 expression could be induced by estrogen, and NDRG4 might play an important role during early pregnancy.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>Emrbyo implantation is a precisely regulated step during establishment of pregnancy. Impaired implantation could cause placentation-related diseases, such as preeclampsia (PE) and recurrent miscarriages (RM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref002">2</xref>]. The formation of uterine receptivity is an essential event for the scuccessful embryo implantation, and it has been well demonstrated that, ovarian hormones, progesterone and estrogen, control the development of uterine receptivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>Uterine development occurs postnatally in an ovary- and steroid-dependent manner in many species, including rodent and human. Endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and stromal cells (ESCs) in uterine tissues of sexually matured individual produce molecules that are essential for embryo survival and implantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref004">4</xref>]. A series of complex physiological events occur during the exquisitely regulated process of implantation, including extensive degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, invasion of trophoblast cells into the maternal endometrium, and decidualization of ESCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref005">5</xref>]. Given many similarities exist between the embryo implantation and the tumorgenesis, such as establishment of an invasive phenotype, repression of specific cell adhesion molecules, elaboration of matrix-digesting enzymes, expression of proto-oncogene products, acquisition of a rich blood supply, and elude the immune system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref006">6</xref>], molecules involved in tumorgenesis might also play critical role in embryo implantation.</p>
        <p>Myc protein is a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and exerts its biological functions through direct or indirect activation of its downstream regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref007">7</xref>]. N-myc belongs to the Myc family and presents a dynamic expression pattern during mouse embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref008">8</xref>]. N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 4 (NDRG4) is a member of the N-Myc downstream regulated gene family (NDRG). The NDRG family is highly conserved, and the identity between human NDRG4 and mouse NDRG4 is about 98% when running Blast in Pubmed. It has been reported that, NDRG4 was predominantly expressed in the early postnatal brain and involved in cell growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref010">10</xref>]. Meanwhile, accumulated evidences showed that NDRG4 possess tumor-suppressive and oncogenic functions depending on the tissue type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref011">11</xref>], and might be a potential biomarker for predicting aggressive forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
        <p>Recently, a role of NDRG2 in mouse embryo implantation was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref015">15</xref>], and one of the predicted upstream-regulated microRNAs of NDRG4, miR-3074-5p, was found to be involved in embryo implantation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref016">16</xref>], thus, we hypothesized that NDRG4 might also participate in the embryo implantation, and the present study was undertaken to examine the uterine expression pattern of NDRG4 during the peri-implantation period in mice and its role in decidualization of ESCs.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>In the present study, we demonstrated the uterine expression pattern of NDRG4 during different postnatal development, the estrous cycle and early pregnancy in mice. The uterine NDRG4 expression level was increased along with the mouse puberal development, and its expression in adult females peaked at the estrus stage. Exogenous estrogen could induce the uterine expression of NDRG4 both in pre-puberty females and ovariectomized adult females. During early pregnancy, uterine NDRG4 expression was significantly increased at implantation sites, with predominant localization in the decidual zone and invaded trophablasts. The increase of NDRG4 expression was accompanied by the activation of delayed implantation, as well as artificially induced decidualization both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, down-regulation of NDRG4 expression in mouse ESCs significantly inhibited decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>. The significant decrease in expression of NDRG4 in human villus tissues of RM patients was also observed.</p>
        <p>Uterine development occurs postnatally in an ovary- and steroid-independent manner, and the synergistic actions of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> are critical for regulation of the estrous cycle and establishment of uterine receptivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref018">18</xref>]. It was found in the present study that, uterine NDRG4 expression was significantly increased after E<sub>2</sub> administration, and during the normal estrous cycle, uterine NDRG4 expression was significantly increased at the estrous stage of which E<sub>2</sub> surge takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref019">19</xref>], indicating a stimulating effect of estrogen on the uterine expression of NDRG4 in mice. Estrogen is involved in a variety of reproductive functions. Mammalian endometrium maintain regular estrous cycle and achieve an optimal uterine environment for embryo implantation through estrogen receptor (ER) pathway. In estrogen classical pathway, the activated ER binds to estrogen response elements (EREs) of the target gene to regulate its expression. However, it has been demonstrated that estrogen could regulate gene expression through the nonclassical pathway, in which the activated ER interacts with transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref020">20</xref>]. It has been reported that AP-1 binding site was a candidate regulatory element in NDRG4 molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref021">21</xref>]. As NDRG4 protein was detected in endometrial epithelial cells and stromal cells, we speculated that it might participate in regulating cyclic proliferation and differentiation in endometrial epithelial/stromal cells to optimally prepare for embryo implantation under the control of E<sub>2</sub> through nonclassical ER/AP-1 pathway during the estrous cycle.</p>
        <p>Successful embryo implantation is integral to the establishment of pregnancy, and initiation of implantation coincides with the establishment of uterine receptivity and the subsequent decidualization of ESCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref022">22</xref>]. In the mouse, a pre-ovulatory E<sub>2</sub> surge stimulates the proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) on day 1 of pregnancy, followed by a rise in the P<sub>4</sub> level to initiate the proliferation of ESCs on day 3. Embryos enter the uterus at midnight on day 3 or in the early hours of day 4 after the uterus is exposed to an increased concentration of P<sub>4</sub> for at least 24 h on day 3 followed by exposure to estrogen, causing it to be receptive for embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref023">23</xref>]. Given during the pre-implantation period from day 1 to day 4 of pregnancy, uterine NDRG4 expression level sustainedly increased, suggesting a potential role of NDRG4 in establishing uterine receptivity under the regulation of estrogen.</p>
        <p>Once mouse embryos attach to a receptive endometrium, decidualization is triggered by extensive proliferation and differentiation of ESCs into decidual stromal cells (DSCs) at implantation sites. Because the decidual response can be induced in a reproducible manner in the absence of an embryo and decidual zones are easily discernable, the mouse is a good model to investigate the mechanism of decidualization. In the mouse, at least three factors may be necessary for normal decidualization, including E<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>4</sub> and embryonic or physical stimulation (by intra-luminal infusion of oil or scratching with a needle). Increases in E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of ESCs surrounding invading trophoblast cells to support the decidualization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref025">25</xref>]. In the present study, a significant increase in NDRG4 expression was observed at implantation sites from day 5 to day 8 of pregnancy, and NDRG4 protein signals were predominantly localized to the decidual zone and invading trophoblast cells. Moreover, NDRG4 expression in uterine tissues and ESCs could be induced by artificial decidualization, and down-regulated expression of NDRG4 in ESCs by <italic>NDRG4</italic>-targeting siRNAs was found to remarkably inhibit decidualization <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that NDRG4 might participate in decidualization process during the early pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Although the exact role of NDRG4 in regulating ESCs and DSCs needs to be further explored, it has been reported that NDRG4 was a novel oncogenic protein and p53 associated regulator of apoptosis in malignant meningioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref026">26</xref>]. Differentiation of ESCs into DSCs is crucial for optimal endometrial receptivity. Apoptosis in the human endometrium plays an essential role for endometrial receptivity and early implantation. It has been suggested the pro-survival signaling pathways Erk1/2 as key regulators of the sensitivity of human ESCs for death receptor-mediated apoptosis during implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref027">27</xref>]. Previous results suggested that, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, as p53 pathway members, played a role in the cell cycle regulation of ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref028">28</xref>], and the rapid activation of intracellular signalling cascades ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt by growth factors and estrogens was involved in the migration of normal ESCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref029">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, it was reported that NDRG4 might play a role in supporting the activation of Erk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, it was reasonable to believe that the function of NDRG4 in ESCs and DSCs might be partially regulated by the p53 signaling pathway(s). In addition, it has been found that Erk1/2 were widely expressed throughout early-stage embryos and involved in the trophoblast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref031">31</xref>]. And in the present study, the NDRG4 expression was also observed in trophoblast cells at implantation sites on day 8 of pregnancy, we hypothesize that NDRG4 might also be involved in the invasion of trophoblast cells during early pregnancy.</p>
        <p>It was recently reported that the expression level of miR-3074-5p at the implantation sites was significantly down-regulated compared to that at the inter-implantation sites, and its expression level was remarkably decreased in villus tissues of RM patients compared to that in normal pregnant women. Given NDRG4 is one of the predicted targets of miR-3074-5p, and we supposed that NDRG4 might be participate in the invasion of trophoblasts, and we therefore examined the expression of NDRG4 in human villus tissues of RM patients and normal pregnant women. It was found that the expression level of NDRG4 protein was significantly decreased in RM patients. Although this preliminary data are encouraging, the sample number was too small to guarantee the confidence. Thus, next investigation would be carried out based on a larger number of human decidual and villus specimens collected from normal pregnant women and RM patients or PE patients, with a view to futher explore the potentiality of NDRG4 to be a novel biomarker for predicting impaired implantation and placentation-related diseases.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that estrogen stimulated the uterine NDRG4 expression and that NDRG4 expression level was significantly up-regulated at implantation sites during early pregnancy in mice. And an increased expression of NDRG4 was associated with the decidualization and down-regulation of NDRG4 expression in ESCs inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> decidualization of ESCs. The NDRG4 expression level was significantly decreased in villus tissues of RM patients. These results suggest that NDRG4 might play critical roles in embryo implantation under the regulation of estrogen. Further investigation to study the precise molecular mechanism of NDRG4 will lead to a better understanding of embryo implantation and hopefully, the information obtained from mouse could be extrapolated to humans.</p>

One-week-old female mice (pre-pubertal stage) were divided into 3 groups (n = 3, per group) at random, and administered daily subcutaneous injections of (1) 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>, 8 ng/g body weight; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), (2) progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>, 50 μg/g body weight; Sigma), or (3) sesame oil (0.1 ml/mouse), respectively, for 7 days as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref034">34</xref>]. Adult female mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (40mg/kg) and laparotomies were performed to remove bilateral ovary. Then the ovariectomized female mice were moved to a warm stage until they recovered from anesthesis. Then ovariectomized female mice were allowed to rest for 2 weeks. Then, the ovariectomized mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 3, per group) and injected with (1) sesame oil (0.1 ml/mouse), (2) E<sub>2</sub> (4 ng/g body weight), (3) P<sub>4</sub> (40 μg/g body weight), or (4) E<sub>2</sub> (4 ng/g body weight) plus P<sub>4</sub> (40 μg/g body weight) according to previously described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref036">36</xref>]. Steroids were dissolved in sesame oil and injected subcutaneously at the same volume (0.1 ml/mouse). The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 24 h after treatment, and the uterine horns were collected.</p>
        <p>To determine the uterine expression pattern of NDRG4 during early pregnancy, adult female mice were mated with fertile males of the same strain to achieve pregnancy (day 1 = day of vaginal plug). Pregnancy was confirmed on days 1 and 4 by recovering embryos from the reproductive tracts. Trypan blue dye solution (0.1% in saline (w/v), 0.1 ml per mouse, Sigma) was injected via the tail vein on day 5 to visualize the implantation sites. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the entire uterine horn was collected from the pregnant mice on days 1 and 4 of pregnancy (n = 3, per day). Uterine tissues at the implantation sites (IS) and inter-implantation sites (int-IS) were separately collected from the pregnant mice on days 5 to 8 of pregnancy (n = 3, per day).</p>
        <p>Pseudopregnant mice were obtained by mating adult females with vasectomized adult males. Vasectomy was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref037">37</xref>]. Briefly, adult male mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (40mg/kg). The bilateral vas deferens were cut in two points at once with a micro dissecting serrated forceps, and the muscle and skin were sutured. Then the vasectomized male mice were moved to a warm place until they recovered from anesthesis. The vasectomized male would be ready to mate 2 weeks after surgery. To examine implantation, female mice were mated with vasectomized males to induce pseudopregnancy. The day of observation of a vaginal plug was considered to be day 1 of pseudopregnancy. Artificial decidualization was induced by intraluminally infusing 25 μl of sesame oil into one uterine horn on day 4 of pseudopregnancy mice (n = 3) after anaesthetized with pentobarbital (40mg/kg), and the contralateral un-injected horn served as a control (n = 3). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 72 h after decidualization was artificially induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref038">38</xref>]. Decidualization was confirmed by both weighing the uterine horns and histological examination of the uterine sections.</p>
        <p>In the delayed embryo implantation model, pregnant female mice were bilaterally ovariectomized under ether anesthesia at 08:30–09:00 h on day 4 of pregnancy. The animals in the delayed embryo implantation group and activation group were subcutaneously injected with P<sub>4</sub> (1 mg/25 g body weight) dissolved in corn oil at 10:00 h from days 4 through 7 of pregnancy to maintain delayed implantation. Then, the animals in the activated implantation group (n = 3) received E<sub>2</sub> (25 ng/25 g body weight) along with P<sub>4</sub> to activate embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref039">39</xref>]. The female mice were euthanized at 10:00 h on day 8 of pregnancy, and the embryos were verified as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref040">40</xref>]. Delayed or activated implantation was confirmed by microscopic observation of the metabolically dormant or activated blastocyst in the uterine flush, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref038">38</xref>].</p>

        <title>Patients and tissues</title>
        <p>All participants in this study were recruited from June 2013 to August 2013 at the outpatient department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, China. Trying to avoid the disturbance of confounding factors on subsequent analyses, all participants were recruited according to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six RM patients (age: 29.67 ± 2 years and gestational age at sampling 7.5 ± 0.67 weeks (mean ± S.D.)), who had experienced at least two consecutive embryonic losses before the 12th gestational week and whose current pregnancy loss was objectively confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound exam, were recruited in the RM group. All clinical summaries about their personal history for thromboembolic disease and successful pregnancy or previous pregnancy losses were obtained. Classical risk factors such as abnormal parental karyotypes, uterine anatomical abnormalities, infectious diseases, luteal phase defects, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia were excluded by medical examinations. Meanwhile, six clinically normal pregnant (NP) women (age: 28.17 ± 4.16 years and gestational age at sampling 6.67 ± 0.44 weeks (mean ± S.D.)) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0155491.t001">Table 1</xref>), which were terminated for non-medical reasons and undergoing legal abortions around the 6th-12th gestational week were recruited in the normal pregnancy group as the control. They were also checked for classical risk factor for pregnancy loss. After informed consent was obtained, villus tissues were collected by curettage from these 12 participants respectively. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committees of Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research (Ref # 2013–7, 2013–12). Written informed consents were obtained from all patients who provided tissue samples, and we have also obtained consents to publish research data derived from these collected samples.</p>

        <p>The isolation and culture of mouse ESCs was performed following previously described methods with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155491.ref041">41</xref>]. In summary, uterine horns were collected from pregnant mice on day 4 and cleaned to remove fat tissues. They were then slit longitudinally and washed thoroughly in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Next, the tissues were placed in HBSS containing 10 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), 6 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature and 10 min at 37°C. Following the digestion steps, the tissues were gently mixed, and the supernatant was discarded to remove the endometrial epithelial clumps. The partially digested tissues were then washed twice in HBSS and placed into HBSS containing 0.15 mg/ml collagenase (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min. Following digestion and shaking, the contents of the tube were passed through a 70 μm gauze filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to eliminate epithelial sheets. The cell pellets were washed twice and added to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium-F12 medium (DMEM/F12) containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and antibiotics at 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 6-well cell culture plate (Invitrogen). After incubation for 1 h, unattached cells were removed by several washes with HBSS, and cell culturing was continued after the addition of fresh DMEM/F12 containing 1% charcoal-stripped FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 nM E<sub>2</sub>, and 1 μM P<sub>4</sub> to induce decidualization of the ESCs.</p>

        <p>Uterine tissues were fixed in freshly prepared 4% buffered paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C for over 40 h. Then, the tissues were dehydrated in graded alcohol and embedded in paraffin (Leica, Wetzlar, Hessen, Germany). Sections of uteri were processed for immunohistochemical detection. Briefly, the sections (5 m) were deparaffinized and rehydrated in xylene and a graded series of ethyl alcohol, respectively, and then rinsed in PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by placing the slides in boiling citric acid buffer (10 mmol/l of citrate sodium and 10 mmol/l of citric acid) for 15 min. The sections were cooled to room temperature and sequentially incubated at room temperature with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in methanol for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidases. The sections were then incubated with a rabbit anti-NDRG4 primary antibody (H00065009-M01, Abnova, Taiwan) overnight at 4°C. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with a biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200 in blocking solution, Proteintech Company, Wuhan, China). After another wash in PBS, they were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:200 in blocking solution, Proteintech Company) for 2 h. Then, they were stained with DAB (Zhongshan Corp., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma). For the negative controls, 10% donkey serum was used instead of primary antibody. All the sections were examined and photographed under a microscope (DFC420C, Leica).</p>

Extracted RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC, Sigma)-treated water, and the RNA concentration and purity were estimated by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNAs was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed in a 20 μl reaction volume using an ABI 7500 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The thermal cycling conditions were 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 30 sec. Melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were then conducted to monitor the purity of the PCR products. Beta-actin was used as an endogenous control.

              <abstract>
                <p>Diabetes is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which in turn facilitates the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs activate signaling proteins such as Src, Akt and ERK1/2. However, the mechanisms by which AGEs activate these kinases remain unclear. We examined the effect of AGEs on Akt activation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Addition of AGEs to 3T3-L1 cells activated Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The AGEs-stimulated Akt activation was blocked by a PI3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002, Src inhibitor PP2, an antioxidant NAC, superoxide scavenger Tiron, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase inhibitor DPI, suggesting the involvement of Src and NAD(P)H oxidase in the activation of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway by AGEs. AGEs-stimulated Src tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by NAC, suggesting that Src is downstream of NAD(P)H oxidase. The AGEs-stimulated Akt activity was sensitive to Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) kinase inhibitor AG1024. Furthermore, AGEs induced phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptorβsubunit (IGF-1Rβ) on Tyr1135/1136, which was sensitive to PP2, indicating that AGEs stimulate Akt activity by transactivating IGF-1 receptor. In addition, the AGEs-stimulated Akt activation was attenuated by β-methylcyclodextrin that abolishes the structure of caveolae, and by lowering caveolin-1 (Cav-1) levels with siRNAs. Furthermore, addition of AGEs enhanced the interaction of phospho-Cav-1 with IGF-1Rβ and transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with Cav-1 Y14F mutants inhibited the activation of Akt by AGEs. These results suggest that AGEs activate NAD(P)H oxidase and Src which in turn phosphorylates IGF-1 receptor and Cav-1 leading to activation of IGF-1 receptor and the downstream Akt in 3T3-L1 cells. AGEs treatment promoted the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and addition of AG1024, LY 294002 or Akt inhibitor attenuated the promoting effect of AGEs on adipogenesis, suggesting that IGF-1 receptor, PI3-Kinase and Akt are involved in the facilitation of adipogenesis by AGEs.</p>

              <p>Glucose and other reducing sugars can react non-enzymatically with the amino groups of proteins and lipids to form Schiff bases. The Schiff bases are slowly rearranged to form Amadori products which then undergo further rearrangements, oxidation, dehydration and condensation resulting in compounds called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are formed in normal physiological condition. The formation and accumulation of AGEs are accelerated in tissues from aged individuals and diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Nass1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Mendez1">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>AGEs exert their cellular functions via the interaction with their specific receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Ramasamy1">[7]</xref>. Binding of AGEs to RAGE activates a variety of signaling proteins and downstream transcription factors including Src, NAD(P)H oxidase, Ras/ERK1/2, PI3K/PDK1/Akt, p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and AP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Nass1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Lin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Goh1">[5]</xref>. Activation of RAGE by AGEs stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NAD(P)H oxidase or mitochondria in several cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Urata1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Coughlan1">[13]</xref>. It has been shown that activation of PI3K by AGEs is dependent on the generation of ROS in mesangial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Xu1">[10]</xref>. However, little is known about the proximal signaling events downstream of RAGE.</p>
              <p>Caveolae are membrane regions enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. The major proteins in caveolae are caveolins which serve as structural elements of caveolae. The mammalian caveolin gene family consists of caveolin-1, -2 and -3. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is ubiquitously expressed. Caveolin-2 is co-expressed with Cav-1, whereas caveolin-3 is exclusively expressed in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Mercier1">[14]</xref>. Caveolins function as scaffolding proteins which recruit numerous signaling molecules to the plasma membrane and regulate their activity. For instance, RAGE, EGF receptor, insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, Src, PKA, PKC, Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and PI3-kinase are localized in caveolae [for review, see 14–18]. Therefore, caveolae represent areas in which signaling proteins and their downstream effectors are substantially enriched.</p>
              <p>Adipose tissue comprises of adipocytes, preadipocytes and other cell types. All cell types in adipose tissue are constantly exposed to AGEs that are generated even in the normal glucose condition. 3T3-L1 cells, derived from dissociated near term Swiss 3T3 mouse embryos, are a widely used model system for preadipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Green1">[19]</xref>. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which AGEs activate Akt in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Since RAGE and several signaling proteins are localized in caveolae and caveolins regulate a variety of signaling pathways, we also examined the involvement of Cav-1 in RAGE-mediated Akt activation in 3T3-L1 cells. Our results showed that NAD(P)H oxidase, Src and IGF-1 receptor transactivation are involved in the activation of Akt by AGEs. 3T3-L1 cells can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes by IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin/IGF-1. Since AGEs transactivate IGF-1 receptor, we further examined whether AGEs affect the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.</p>

                <p>We further investigated whether Cav-1, the major component in caveolae, is involved in the AGEs signaling cascade. It has been reported that IGF-1 receptor directly interacts with Cav-1 in 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Huo1">[41]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether Cav-1 is involved in the AGEs-mediated IGF-1R transactivation and Akt activation employing co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with and without 100 µg/ml AGEs for 15 min. After incubation, IGF-1R proteins were immunoprecipitated by IGF-1Rβ antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using Cav-1 and phospho-Cav-1 (at Y14) antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6D</xref> showed that Cav-1 associated with the β-subunit of IGF-1R, and that addition of AGEs enhanced the association of phospho-Cav-1 with IGF-1Rβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). To examine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1, we generated stable cell lines expressing vector pcDNA3.1 or Cav-1 Y14F mutant, and then challenged both vector control and Cav-1 Y14F expressing cells with 100 µg/ml AGEs for 15 min. The cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analysis with Cav-1, p-Cav-1, Akt, p-Akt, Src, p-Src, pIGF-1Rβ<sup>pY1131</sup> and IGF-1Rβ antibodies. The results showed that Cav-1 Y14F expressing cells exhibited reduced p-Cav-1 and phosphor-Akt levels in the absence of AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Cav-1 Y14F expressing cells exhibited slightly elevated p-IGF-1R and phospho-Src levels in the absence of AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). However, unlike control cells, addition of AGEs failed to phosphorylate Y14 on Cav-1, phosphorylate Y1135/1136 on IGF-1R, phosphorylate Y416 on Src and to activate Akt in Cav-1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1 is essential for AGEs-mediated Akt activation.</p>
                <p>Src is known to be present in caveolae and phosphorylate Cav-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Reddy1">[26]</xref>. To determine whether Src is responsible for the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1, we incubated 3T3-L1 cells with and without 10 µM PP2 for 30 min, and then challenged cells with 100 µg/ml AGEs for 15 min. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analysis with p-Cav-1 antibodies. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with AGEs increased the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Cav-1, whereas addition of PP2 decreased the AGEs-enhanced tyrosine-phosphorylated Cav-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>). These results suggest that Src is responsible for the AGEs-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1.</p>

              <p>Chronic hyperglycemia which is characteristic of diabetes facilitates the formation of AGEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Nass1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Mendez1">[6]</xref>. Formation of AGEs is considered a potential link between hyperglycemia and chronic diabetic complications such as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Nass1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Yan1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Mendez1">[6]</xref>. AGEs also accumulate in many different tissues during the normal aging process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Nass1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Lin1">[3]</xref>. Many of the effects of AGEs are mediated by their signaling receptor RAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Ramasamy1">[7]</xref>. Although AGEs and RAGE have been shown to activate a variety of protein kinases such as Akt, ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK, little is known about the proximal signaling events downstream of RAGE. In the present study, we showed for the first time that via RAGE, NAD(P)H oxidase and Src, AGEs transactivate IGF-1 receptor and the downstream PI3-kinase-PDK1-Akt pathway in 3T3-L1 cells. We have also found that phospho-Cav-1 plays a positively regulatory role in AGEs-mediated Akt activation.</p>
              <p>The signaling events that link RAGE to NAD(P)H oxidase, Src and Akt remain unclear. Our results showed that AGEs activated Akt via PI3-kinase since the AGEs-stimulated Akt activity was inhibited by a PI3-K inhibitor LY294002. The effects of AGEs on Akt activation are mediated by their receptor RAGE as neutralizing RAGE antibodies attenuated the activation of Akt by AGEs. The AGEs-stimulated Akt activity was blocked by NAC, an antioxidant, Tiron, a superoxide scavenger and DPI and apocynin, NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suggesting that NAD(P)H oxidase and reactive oxygen species participate in the activation of Akt by AGEs. Src is a redox-sensitive tyrosine kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Giannoni1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Catarzi1">[29]</xref>. Our data showed that AGEs activated Src, and that the AGEs-stimulated Akt activation was attenuated by PP2, a Src inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of Src in the activation of Akt by AGEs. Furthermore, we found that AGEs-stimulated Src kinase activity was blocked by NAC, suggesting that Src is downstream of NAD(P)H oxidase. These results suggest that AGEs activate NAD(P)H oxidase and produce reactive oxygen species which then stimulate Src kinase activity leading to activation of the PI3-kinase-PDK1-Akt pathway.</p>
              <p>Binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R is known to activate the downstream Akt and ERK1/2 by tyrosine-phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS) and Shc. Besides stimulating its own signaling pathways, IGF-1 receptor can be transactivated by a variety of receptors such as angiotensin II, endothelin-1, estrogen, and epidermal growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Santen1">[30]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Hallak1">[36]</xref>. IGF-1 receptor is ubiquitously expressed and also present in 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Huo1">[41]</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of IGF-1 receptor in the activation of Akt by AGEs in 3T3-L1 cells. First, AGEs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1Rβ and the downstream IRS-1. Second, addition of IGF-1 receptor kinase inhibitor AG1024 attenuated AGEs-stimulated Akt activity. Third, AGEs activated Src and enhanced the association of activated Src with IGF-1Rβ. Furthermore, inhibition of Src with PP2 blocked both AGEs-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1Rβand AGEs-stimulated Akt activity. These results suggest that Src is upstream of IGF-1 receptor. Precedents for the involvement of Src in the transactivation of IGF-1 receptor were reported by Zahradka <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Zahradka1">[34]</xref> and Bouallegue <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Bouallegue1">[35]</xref>. Both groups found that Ang II or endothelin-1 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IGF-1Rβ and a Src inhibitor PP1 or PP2 weakens the phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor. Src is also a mediator of IGF-1 receptor transactivation in response to EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Hallak1">[36]</xref>. Thus, activation of Src appears to be essential for the transactivation of IGF-1 receptor by Ang II, endothelin-1, EGF and AGEs.</p>
              <p>Although Ang II, EGF and endothelin-1 are reported to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IGF-1Rβ, the identity of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Santen1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Hallak1">[36]</xref>. Y1131, Y1135 and Y1136 are the autophosphorylation sites on the activation loop of the IGF-1Rβ catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Li3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Li4">[45]</xref>. Binding of IGF1 to the α subunit of IGF-1 receptor triggers a conformational change leading to autophosphorylation of these tyrosine residues. It has been shown that the first site of autophosphorylation is predominantly Y1135, followed by Y1131 and then by Y1136, and that each phosphorylation increases receptor tyrosine kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Li4">[45]</xref>. We examined whether these tyrosine residues on IGF-1Rβ are phosphorylated by AGEs using antibodies recognizing p-Y1135/1136 and p-Y1131 on IGF-1Rβ. The results indicated that the phosphorylation levels of Y1135/1136, but not Y1131, on IGF-1Rβ were enhanced by AGEs. These results indicate that AGEs triggers the phosphorylation of at least Y1135 and Y1136 on IGF-1Rβ. Src has been shown to phosphorylate Y1131, Y1135 and Y1136 on IGF-1R and activate IGF-1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Peterson1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Peterson2">[47]</xref>. Consistently with those reports, our data showed that AGEs activated Src and induced phosphorylation of Y1135 and Y1136 on IGF-1Rβ. Blockage of Src kinase activity with PP2 attenuated the AGEs-induced phosphorylation of Y1135 and Y1136 on IGF-1 receptor and AGEs-stimulated Akt activation. Therefore, Src likely mediates the effects of AGEs on the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IGF-1 receptor.</p>
              <p>Many signaling proteins and receptors are enriched in caveolae. Previous studies showed that RAGE, IGF-IR, and Src family tyrosine kinases localize in caveolae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Coughlan1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Lisanti1">[18]</xref>. Cav-1 has been shown to positively regulate IGF-1 signaling by stabilizing IGF-1 receptor and IRS-1. Protein levels of IRS-1 and IGF-1 receptor are reduced in Cav-1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Chen2">[48]</xref>. Reduced IRS-1 levels were also reported in Cav-1 knock-down H9C2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Salani1">[49]</xref>. In contrast, over-expression of Cav-1 significantly increases protein levels of IGF-1 receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Glait1">[50]</xref>. However, in contrast to mouse embryo fibroblasts and H9C2 cells, knock-out or knock-down of Cav-1 does not affect the IGF-1 signaling in 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Hong1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Matthews1">[52]</xref>. It appears that the role of Cav-1 in IGF-1 signaling is cell type-specific. In this study, our data showed that depletion of cholesterol by β-MCD significantly reduced AGEs-stimulated Akt activation in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that caveolae and Cav-1 are important for AGEs-mediated Akt activation. IGF-1 receptor has been shown to directly interact with Cav-1 in 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Huo1">[41]</xref>. Consistently with these findings, our data showed that Cav-1 associated with IGF-1 receptor in 3T3-L1 cells. Cav-1 can be phosphorylated on Tyr 14 by Src family kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Reddy1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Lee1">[53]</xref>. We further found that addition of AGEs activated Src and increased the phosphorylation of Tyr 14 on Cav-1 (p-Cav-1). AGEs also increased the association of p-Cav-1 with IGF-1 receptor in 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast, addition of PP2 attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Cav-1 and IGF-1Rβ and decreased the downstream Akt signaling. Furthermore, expression of Cav-1 Y14F decreased the levels of p-Cav-1 and AGEs-stimulated Akt activation. These results suggest that p-Cav-1 positively regulates the transactivation of IGF-1 receptor by RAGE and Src.</p>
              <p>3T3-L1 cells can differentiate into adipocytes. The IGF-1 receptor signaling is required for the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Smith1">[54]</xref>. Since AGEs transactivate IGF-1 receptor, we examined the effects of AGEs on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, and found that AGEs treatment increased the amount of lipid droplet accumulation as compared to the control. Similar results have been reported by other investigators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Wu1">[42]</xref>. PPARγ is the master transcription factor governing adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Kawai1">[43]</xref>. Ectopic expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts induces adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Tontonoz1">[55]</xref>. In contrast, embryonic fibroblasts derived from PPARγ-null mice fail to differentiate into adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Kubota1">[56]</xref>. C/EBPα is another important transcription factor regulating adipogenesis. Ectopic expression of the C/EBPα has been shown to promote adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058100-Freytag1">[57]</xref>. We further showed that AGEs treatment increased levels of PPARγand C/EBPα. AGEs treatment also increased levels of the adipocyte markers aP2 and GPDH activity. These results suggest that AGEs promote adipogenesis by up-regulating PPARγand C/EBPα. Furthermore, addition of AG1024, LY 294002 or Akt inhibitor attenuated the level of PPARγ and aP2 and the promoting effect of AGEs on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that IGF-1 receptor, PI3-Kinase and Akt are involved in the facilitation of adipogenesis by AGEs. Obesity is known to increase the risk of developing type II diabetes. In the cell level, obesity is due to increased differentiation of preadipocytes and enlargement of existing adipocytes. It is known that AGEs formation is enhanced in diabetes. The fact that AGEs promote adipogenesis (i.e., obesity) might further accelerate diabetes and create a vicious cycle. Further investigation is required to delineate the complicated interactions among AGEs, obesity and diabetes.</p>
              <p>In summary, the data presented in this study suggest that IGF-1 receptor transactivation is required for the activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway by AGEs in 3T3-L1 cells. This mechanism involves RAGE that couples to NAD(P)H oxidase to stimulate Src. The activated Src in turn phosphorylates and activates IGF-1 receptor and its downstream PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. Our data also reveal that Src phosphorylates Cav-1, and that p-Cav-1 associates with IGF-1 receptor and is positively involved in the activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway by AGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058100-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Our study shows that besides G protein-coupled receptors (Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 receptors) and nuclear receptors (estrogen receptors), RAGE, a receptor of the immunoglobulin-like superfamily, can also transactivate IGF-1 receptor. Since AGEs and RAGE are involved in diabetic complications and other diseases, IGF-1 receptor antagonists and cholesterol depleting agents might have therapeutic application to these disorders.</p>
